ekg32dh,"Incest never results from a healthy environment/upbringing/mental state. It is a perversion of fundamental norms of familial relationships that almost always indicates something *seriously wrong*. It's not that incest is ""inherently"" wrong, after all if two well-adjusted adults who happened to be from the same family started banging, that would be fine. The issue is that is almost never how incest arises. Even between cousins/siblings, it's *at best* a result of social isolation, codependency, maladjusted social interactions, or shared trauma. This is why incest is so maligned - even when the incest itself isn't abuse, it is a huge indicator of a seriously troubled situation/people. Which isn't to say it's always ""morally wrong"" to *do* so much as it is the outcome of a morally wrong/unhealthy situation. So most people don't bother delving into the details of it and are fine with incest just continuing to be wrong.

b0vtr6-post,"Not gonna lie, for like the last 3 years, depression was kicking my ass. I was out of shape and miserable all the time. I was stuck in a downward spiral of self pity and loathing and it only made my condition worse. 
 
 Something clicked a couple months ago. I think i realized what i was doing- i had pushed away so many loving individuals while gaining weight and playing too many videogames. I figured that the only person who could help me get out of this loop was myself. I decided i would eat better, go to the gym, and reconnect with those i pushed away. 
 
 Back to the pull up- with the help of some buddies i started exercising regularly. When i started, i absolutely hated it. But i kept going to the gym every day, and got stronger and stronger which led to today, i was finally able to do 2 full range of motion pull ups without any kind of resistance band or kip up! 
 
 Im really proud of myself for this. Im still a chubby dude (5 foot 8 in, 165 lbs), but its so cool to see myself improve. Just a couple months ago, i was a fat stereotypical asian gamer lookin dude. But a couple days ago, i got complimented on my new (albeit chunky) muscle definition, and goddamn it feels good! 
 
 Its not like ive eliminated all my flaws. I still stress eat and sleep too little. I still occasionally try too hard to be the funniest person in the room, and project myself onto others. But its baby steps, ya feel? Slowly but surely, im improving myself! 
 
 Its just a fucking pull up but it really means so much more to me. It really feels like ive succeeded at something for the first time in forever. Its the first step towards feeling happy, and normal.

I am aware that not all of Reddit is America, but I'm primarily speaking about the American state, as its the only world view I have right now. 
 
 Mr. Rogers taught us to love one another in spite of differences. The man so hated television that he changed it by himself through his program. I feel that we as the children who grew up on his show have failed him and his memory by dividing ourselves. America is so divided these days that people are faking hate crimes and it is believable to an extent. I think that we as his former audience need to remember the tolerance he preached. 
 
 His message of Everyone is Special is often derided as being unrralistic as ""if everyone is special then no one is."" But that isnt what Everyone is Special means. It means that we are all deserving of anothers love for what makes us unique. Yes there are bad people out there.

avw8qz-post,"**Context** 
 
 This subreddit focuses on the Duggars, an American fundamentalist Christian family with 19 children from the same parents. This denomination of Christianity is extremely strict. Most of the women only wear skirts below the knee, the children are homeschooled, and they reject modern music and media. The Duggar family had a reality television show called \*19 Kids and Counting\*, which ended due to backlash when it was discovered that the oldest son molested four of the sisters. A new show, called \*Counting On\*, focuses on just the adult children and their lives after the scandal. Both of the TV shows used to have their own subreddits, but they became mostly inactive. 
 
 
 
 This subreddit drama focuses on r/DuggarsSnark, a subreddit created to make snark about the Duggar family. However, there has been discussion between members on the subreddit concerning what constitutes snark and what constitutes ""leghumping."" Leghumping is fawning over or praising the Duggars, which is not allowed on the sub. Some people believe positive observations (ex: Her hair looks better than usual) or explaining behavior (ex: Is it normal to eat casserole all the time? Yes, that is normal in some regions) are forms of leghumping, while other people do not believe so. 
 
 
 
 **Original Post** 
 
 [A regular user posted a meme aimed at leghumpers, people in the comments don't like being characterized as leghumpers, there is a fight about what constitutes leghumping]( 
 
 
 
 [The user then decides to leave the sub]( 
 
 
 
 [A different user creates a discussion themed subreddit to supplement the snark subreddit, snark fans tell him to leave](

Think about it, what the fuck athletically are you really doing in golf, my guy? All you doing is hitting a goddamn golf club, ""Oh my God man, that's a long ass birdie man, nice birdie, nice putt, man it went 250 yards."" Get the fuck outta here, nobody care about that boring ass shit. Who the fuck really watches golf, my dude? Nobody gives a fuck, it makes everybody fall asleep. Fishing on the other hand, what the fuck are you really doing athletically, my guy, in fishing? All you're doing is that you're sitting your bitch ass up in a boat, usually it's old ass snagger-teeth motherfuckers that ain't got no goddamn teeth up in they fucking grill, or up in they mouth. They're just sitting up the goddamn boat, you know what I'm saying. Throwing a goddamn rod. It can be any kind of goddamn bait up on the end of the rod.

What, you're working out your arms, because you have to reel that motherfucker in? Man, that's not a sport, dawg. Well, fuck it. You know what, it is a sport. Fuck it. You guys want to consider that shit to be a sport? Jacking off is a fucking sport to me. Jacking off and beating your motherfucking dick to porn is a sport. There's two damn things that you have to do. A. You build up a sweat. Well actually, you don't have to do shit. There's basically two things that goes down, that's what I meant to say. A. You're building up a sweat. I don't give a fuck man, if you are building up a sweat, goddamn it, that's shit is considered a sport. You're building up a sweat. Number 2, and the most important part of that shit, is that your hand is getting a workout. Your hand is getting a workout, man, you are building up your arm strength, and you are building up your hand strength, okay. I don't know about you, dude, but when I'm beating my shit, man, my fucking hand muscles get fucking tight, you know what I'm saying? And that shit wears the fuck out of my entire left arm. I used to be able to do it with my right hand, can't do that shit, so I do it with my left hand. So, in my personal opinion, do you guys consider jacking off a sport? Man, in my opinion, I believe it is. So I know with some of you trolling ass fuckin bitches are gonna say ""Oh, man, you must not get no pussy, motherfucker, if you jack off."" Motherfucker, let's be real, okay? Everybody has jacked off once in they goddamn life. If you gonna sit back, and you gonna come on my video, and troll my shit, say ""Oh, Jimmy, I never jacked off once in my life."" Bitch, stop lying. Everybody does this shit, okay? So please miss me with that bullshit, dude, and go preach that shit to somebody who fucking is actually gonna listen to you, okay? Number 2, ""Oh my God, this comment was stupid. It was pointless."" Couldn't've been that stupid, bitch, you still read it! You know what I'm saying? All the motherfuckers that's reading this, man, you saw the first sentence of the fucking comment before you read this shit.

 There's also the issue where you can basically just go online and get an order for one, without ever really meeting or seeing the person who writes you a letter. I've seen some sites require a ""quick phone call"" and some that don't even require that. 
 
 Considering the benefits, I think ESAs are an overall great thing. Even though there are obstacles or issues that have come up, it's worth tackling them and trying to find solutions rather than abolish the program or hate them out of spite because some people abuse the program like the posters in the OP. 
 
 We can reduce ""ESA fraud"" if that's what we want to call it, but I think it's worth taking the effort to minimize harm to innocents while closing any loopholes or making changes to the program. 
 
 The university situation in particular is interesting. In a lot of dorms things are already cramped and diseases can spread quickly. It's not the healthiest space for humans physically, introducing animals into the situation seems like it could have big repercussions. 
 
 For the record I do have an ESA and I love them to bits. I've stopped taking two different medications for anxiety and depression and my physical health has reached surprising levels even to my other doctors and specialists.",Neutral,0

eo172ql,"Essentially Liu bei is generally portrayed as a benelovent leader who highly values his men, which is why even tho he is likely the least capable of the major warlords, he has the best men working under him. Like, the quality of generals and tactician he has access to is just insanely stacked. 
 
 Zhaoyun is a legendary general. He is not as famous as lu bu in the west, but he is far more famous of a character in East Asia and is basically a lu bu tier martial warrior that is the perfect knight. Think galahad. From Arthurian legends. The way he is potrsyrd, dude is as invincible of a warrior as lu bu, but without the treachery. 
 
 So he risked his life and fraught through a whole army single handed to get his lord's son back. Liu bei was so touched by his action that he felt nothing could be worth risking such a loyal man of talent. Him throwing his son to the ground is an outburst of emotion over how grateful he is to the general. He didn't actually throw him, he got stopped in time (or Zhao Yun caught the baby). Either way, a baby wasn't hurt 
 
 Literary analysis of the scene is actually pretty interesting, since there is a school of thought that presumes Liu bei to be a master manipulator. A guy who knows how to get the best people to be loyal to him. From that perspective, he did what he did to put on a show for Zhao Yun.

 When she comes home from work after a long or bad day she takes it entirely out on me as if I'm a verbal punching bag and I've done so much to try to cheer her up, listen to her, help her get her mind off of it, everything I can do. She doesn't get better until after she talks to her mom. I ask her about her day i get nothing. She tells her mom everything, all about her day and I get cast aside. Then shes laughing as if everything is great. 
 After I'm there trying to comfort her to no avail, then her getting instantly better, I start to feel like I'm not needed. Then she doesn't asks about how my day went. She sometimes will, but I can't even finish telling her things and its only when shes in a good mood (which is maybe 1 or 2 days a week).

ejts6eb,"Many stupid people are using the misquoted and invalid 40% statistic, so here goes. TL:DR; The 40% number is wrong and plain old bad science. In attempt to recreate the numbers, by the same researchers, they received a rate of 24% while including violence as shouting. Further researchers found rates of 7%, 7.8%, 10%, and 13% with stricter definitions and better research methodology. 
 
 The 40% claim is intentionally misleading and unequivocally inaccurate. Numerous studies over the years report domestic violence rates in police families as low as 7%, with the highest at 40% defining violence to include shouting or a loss of temper. The referenced study where the 40% claim originates is Neidig, P.H.., Russell, H.E. & Seng, A.F. (1992). Interspousal aggression in law enforcement families: A preliminary investigation. It states: 
 
 Survey results revealed that approximately 40% of the participating officers reported marital conflicts involving physical aggression in the previous year. 
 
 There are a number of flaws with the aforementioned study: 
 
 The study includes as 'violent incidents' a one time push, shove, shout, loss of temper, or an incidents where a spouse acted out in anger. These do not meet the legal standard for domestic violence. This same study reports that the victims reported a 10% rate of physical domestic violence from their partner. The statement doesn't indicate who the aggressor is; the officer or the spouse. The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The ""domestic violence"" acts are not confirmed as actually being violent. The study occurred nearly 30 years ago. This study shows minority and female officers were more likely to commit the DV, and white males were least likely. Additional reference from a Congressional hearing on the study: 
 
 An additional study conducted by the same researcher, which reported rates of 24%, suffer from additional flaws: 
 
 The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The study was not a random sample, and was isolated to high ranking officers at a police conference. This study also occurred nearly 30 years ago. 
 
 More current research, including a larger empirical study with thousands of responses from 2009 notes, 'Over 87 percent of officers reported never having engaged in physical domestic violence in their lifetime.' Blumenstein, Lindsey, Domestic violence within law enforcement families: The link between traditional police subculture and domestic violence among police (2009). Graduate Theses and Dissertations. 
 
 Yet another study ""indicated that 10 percent of respondents (148 candidates) admitted to having ever slapped, punched, or otherwise injured a spouse or romantic partner, with 7.2 percent (110 candidates) stating that this had happened once, and 2.1 percent (33 candidates) indicating that this had happened two or three times. Repeated abuse (four or more occurrences) was reported by only five respondents (0.3 percent)."" A.H. Ryan JR, Department of Defense, Polygraph Institute ""The Prevalence of Domestic Violence in Police Families."" 
 
 Another: In a 1999 study, 7% of Baltimore City police officers admitted to 'getting physical' (pushing, shoving, grabbing and/or hitting) with a partner. A 2000 study of seven law enforcement agencies in the Southeast and Midwest United States found 10% of officers reporting that they had slapped, punched, or otherwise injured their partners. L.

epk12ct,"**Martin Luther King Jr.** 
 
 Martin Luther King Jr. (January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American Baptist minister and activist who became the most visible spokesperson and leader in the civil rights movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. Born in Atlanta, King is best known for advancing civil rights through nonviolence and civil disobedience, tactics his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi helped inspire. 
 
 King led the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and in 1957 became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). 
 
 *** 
 
 **Civil rights movement** 
 
 The civil rights movement (also known as the American civil rights movement and other terms) in the United States was a decades-long struggle with the goal of enforcing constitutional and legal rights for African Americans that other Americans already enjoyed. With roots that dated back to the Reconstruction era during the late 19th century, the movement achieved its largest legislative gains in the mid-1960s, after years of direct actions and grassroots protests that were organized from the mid-1950s until 1968. Encompassing strategies, various groups, and organized social movements to accomplish the goals of ending legalized racial segregation, disenfranchisement, and discrimination in the United States, the movement, using major nonviolent campaigns, eventually secured new recognition in federal law and federal protection for all Americans. 
 
 After the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery in the 1860s, the Reconstruction Amendments to the United States Constitution granted emancipation and constitutional rights of citizenship to all African Americans, most of whom had recently been enslaved.

ei2au44,"Meanwhile I'm legitimately sitting here, in the Southern US right now with a white woman asleep next to me. We go out in public together (gasp), I work from home doing my relatively high-income software PMO director job where I have a few dozen white employees in my department, I own my condo and car, I went to the gun range last week for some practice with the firearms I *own*, I went to law school, and I voted in November. 
 
 But yeah it's *super* racist in the South. Basically just like the civil war. You know, the civil war in the 1860s when I was considered property *owned* by someone, couldn't vote, looking at a white woman would've been grounds for the general community to kill me to say nothing of sleeping with one on a regular basis, owning property would've been *hilariously* challenging, and for me to be in possession of a firearm would've been (again) grounds to probably kill me. Pretty sure *knowing how to read* was illegal for black people for awhile, and voting? Haha... no. I think I was still 3/5ths of a person back then. 
 
 These people piss me off because they're denigrating the actual racism my grandparents actually lived through. The Klan walked the streets while sweeping Democratic gun laws stopped my grandparents from owning firearms to protect themselves and their children (my father) and they got poll taxes and literacy tests at the polls removed *in their lifetime*- to say nothing of desegregation. 
 
 Like what the fuck? Where do these people live that they think anywhere South of the Mason-Dixon is somehow some backwater redneck hick town? Atlanta is in the South- the headquarters of their beloved CNN. So is Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, Miami, Knoxville, Charleston, Savannah and a dozen other major metro areas. 
 
 The worst part of it all is that these people remind me more of slaveowners than 'progressives'- every slave master thought they were doing black people a favor: we were godless heathens so they put us to work, gave us a place to sleep and food to eat, and ""civilized the negro"". Hey guys, guess what? If I was being subjected to anything resembling systemic civil war-era racism in the South, I'd pick my black ass up and get the fuck out. I haven't, so either these people think I'm a *massive idiot* incapable of taking care of myself, or they're pushing a false narrative knowingly.

 Personally, I'd say that with the inclusion of tumblrite AAP gaydens and the acknowledgement of bisexuality being a reason for potential AGP/AAP behavior due to a wider spectrum of attractive features leading to a fetishization of one's own attractive features, it would be a nigh-on perfect system.",IdentityDirectedAbuse,1

 It's very close to a contradiction. They could make the claim that, if they were somehow prevented from using piracy, they *still wouldn't buy the game*, therefore it doesn't preclude a potential sale.

 Like, the first thing people turn to is usually the risk of birth defects (which is probably one of the reason that we have a built in level of aversion to incest), but does that really apply in an age when contraception is readily available and widely used? If risk of birth defects in children makes incest wrong, does that mean it's wrong for people with dwarfism to have sex?

anmla4-post,"My best friend, who I grew up with and had a HUGE crush on, and I began talking again after almost 10 years. Back in the day it was the fantasy childhood sweet hearts. We were two peas in a pod and loved being around eachother. Well fast forward a few years we started being intimate. Our family eventually found out and she left me and I left home. Now 10 years later she reached out to me out of the blue and we started talking. Side note, 2018 as a whole was the worst year of my life. When I say the whole year, every month, every day was emotionally and physically taxing to a degree where my hair is literally thining and falling out I mean it(my hair used to be thick and healthy). 
 
 So we start talking and it feels as though no time has passed at all. Its great! I cant believe she is talking to me again. But in my gut I know its just a rebound text(my mom told me she recent broke up with a 2yr relationship). Well she isnt doing to well either and she tries to kill herself so I call out of work for a whole week and I am across the whole country the next day to see her in the hospital. She is finally released and we have an amazing week together! Doing everything, always laughing and just enjoying eachothers company. But theres an issue, she constantly lied to me, about stupid stuff. She is a terrible liar but I never called her out. Even her mom told me she was sleeping with multiple people and when I asked she lied about her previous relationship even though she brought that up. There were so many red flags that I ignored, so many times she made herself to he victim to everything and I knew was trying to get me to feel sorry for her, and I ignored them all because I wanted to support her. On the last night we are snuggled up in her bed as we did everynight and she keeps pulling me on top of her to just ""get closer"" as she says (yeah okay). We start kissing and I ask over and over if its what she wants (i dont want to have sex but i wanted her to be happy and she seemed to really want to) and you can guess what happened. Well I drive home that night and cry all the way home because I know I was just used. 
 
 Over the next couple weeks she slowly talks to me less and less and barely wants to see me after I move back home after almost 10 years away. I finally call her and confront her and she tells me nothing has changed and hasnt talked to me since. 
 
 I am so disgusted with myself for being so easy and ignoring all the signs that she was manipualting me. I cant even look at her because she isnt even the same person she used to be and it hurts so much. Not a single apology or an attempt to say anything from her. I dont know why she used me and I am so broken up about it. I told her all the shit that went down even about me losing my daughter that year (2018) and she still did this. Idk what to do. I want peace but she wont talk to me anymore. 
 
 P.S. There were so many more flags and signs i ignored from family and friends but this post is long enough. 
 
 TL;DR: My best friend/sweet heart from child hood called me up after 10 years. She was struggling so I went to help her out. My time with her was great but there were alot of red flags I ignored. I didnt want to sleep with her but she kept pushing so I did then she started to distance herself from me. I feel so used and disgusted with myself and I dont know why she did it.",Neutral,0

b4si2z-post,"In the recent past, I have lost friends, pets, and my father, the latter of which I watched decline very quickly after a cancer diagnosis. He had lung surgery and needed a device to drain fluid. It was broken. It was broken from the goddamn outset, but the hospital would not give him a new one because insurance said he was only allowed to have one, ever. IT WAS BROKEN. IT WAS FUCKING BROKEN. His doctor stole him a new one (A DOCTOR HAD TO STEAL A MEDICALLY NECESSARY DEVICE IN ORDER TO TEND TO HIS PATIENT. I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT LONG AND HARD), but it didn't matter, because it was too late by then. And anyway, they wanted him out of the hospital when he went back in, because the money is made by cycling patients through, so they pushed him out as fast as they could, so fast that his own discharge came as a surprise to him, because no one had bothered to tell him. 
 
 He worked his ass off his whole fucking life, and he was making six figures when he retired, so you fucking pricks don't sit there and tell me that only moochers complain about the state of our health care. Don't you sit there and fucking tell me that if you just *contribute* you won't have to worry. HE CONTRIBUTED. HE CONTRIBUTED YOU FUCKING FUCK. You're going to meet his fate, do you understand that? If you don't get on board with reforming things, then it doesn't fucking matter how powerful you think you are right now, you little shit. It doesn't matter how much fucking money you make. THE FUCKING DEATH PANELS ARE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, DO YOU HEAR ME? YOUR CADILLAC PLAN WILL DENY YOU SOMETHING YOU NEED SOME DAY FOR SOME BULLSHIT REASON AND YOU WILL FUCKING DIE YOU SELFISH SHORT-SIGHTED JACKASS, YOU WILL FUCKING DIE. I wish I could be there, hovering over you, spitting in your face and telling you that you were part of that, that you could have lived if only you hadn't been a selfish fuck, telling you that you deserve it, that you're reaping what you've sown. I wish I wish I wish. 
 
 My spouse is in the hospital. My spouse will die years before me. I don't know when, but I know how, I know it's coming, and you fucking failed at that too. You failed to give decent health care even to your soldiers, whom you vapidly praise. You stick ""support the troops"" stickers on your fucking bumpers and support politicians who babble on about defense but you don't give two shits about them. If you did, you'd want them to live once they got back here, but you don't. You don't. You turn the other fucking way, because it's all just posturing and social competition, and the idea that a veteran could suffer challenges your assumptions and your childish belief in a just world, and you tell yourself that those who can't make it don't deserve to make it, because if you didn't tell yourself that then you'd have to wrestle with the possibility that whether or not you're ""okay"" doesn't have as much to do with whether you're a good, hard-working person as you've always believed. And if that's so, then maybe, just maybe, you aren't actually a good person. Or, more charitably, maybe you'll never actually be a fucking millionaire, you stupid, useful cunt. You'll never be powerful. Maybe your masters are laughing at you behind your back. 
 
 I hate these people who act ""woke"" but then are horrifyingly Americentric, who want everything to speak to the American experience. How the fuck can you sit there and say that you're progressive and against bigotry while demanding that people from other cultural backgrounds center American culture in their work, and castigating them if they don't? How the fuck can you say you're progressive if you're doing shit like, say, darkening up light-skinned Mexicans because you think Mexican = dark skin, while calling people who depict them with their actual skin tone as ""racist?"" Do you not realize what you are? Do you not realize what you're doing? YOU'RE THE FUCKING RACIST, YOU STUPID BITCH. AND YOU'RE TRYING TO AVOID ACKNOWLEDGING YOUR RACISM BY PINNING IT ON OTHER PEOPLE. 
 
 I'm sick of that in general, all that shit, everyone scapegoating, projecting, what the fuck have you. You know what? It's not that women are all evil sociopaths, or that men or all evil sociopaths, or that Jews run the world; it's not globalists or blacks or immigrants or fucking anyone, IT'S YOU. YOU ARE THE FUCKING PROBLEM IN YOUR OWN FUCKING LIFE. You have zero fucking perspective. The entire reason you're able to sit on twitter and whine about how afraid you are because someone \*gasp\* asked you for an interview is because nothing truly bad has ever fucking happened to you, ever. You're an entitled, privileged brat, as evidenced by the fact that you have the time and money to *sit around on twitter all day.* None of you are genuine. None of you are interested in doing the work to effect real change on the shit that matters. It's just a stupid fucking pissing contest, and you're ACTIVELY MAKING IT HARDER FOR THE REST OF US. YOU ARE CHILDREN. YOU REACHED MIDDLE SCHOOL AND STOPPED DEVELOPING. I want to drop all of you into the wilderness and force you to experience some actual fucking hardship so you can realize that your entire worldview is possible only because you're able to take advantage of modern convenience. 
 
 But how can I, how could I, when I too am sitting here, taking advantage of modern convenience? Aren't I the very thing that I hate? How can any of us critique anything, when all of us are covered in sludge? 
 
 I am losing my ability to be reasonable. I get in fights more often. I keep them away from the people I love, but compartmentalization can only go so far. I feel the pressure building in my head, behind my eyes. I look forward to downtime but do nothing with it. I sit impotent, cycling through a list of possible activities and dismissing them all. It's all empty, accompanied by guilt. I should be doing more. I am not creating value, I am complaining but not generating, I am just like them. I am just like all of the ones I despise, I am becoming them, I will become them, I will die like them and with them. The bluster and anger are fruitless and only an echo of the human condition. We are not fundamentally good. We are fundamentally weak, stupid, and wretched. We are subject to cognitive distortions that we can't ever fully get a handle on, even when we're aware of them. We are subject to passions that drive us to poor decisions and hasty actions, many of them profoundly antisocial. We are angry. We are violent. We are incurably tribal. We are going to destroy ourselves, and possibly take the planet along with us.

They're both pretty unverifiable. They are how they are because they are. 
 
 For example, an evolutionary psychological explanation for getting (sometimes) different outcomes between sexes in spatial/language tests runs along the lines of maybe that's because historically, men needed better spatial skills because they roamed further to hunt while women needed better language skills to mediate conflicts that, as the generally smaller sex, could be fatal for them if they escalate. It's a nice simple theory that makes superficial sense but it can never move past theory because there's simply no way to gather evidence to support it. It's also somewhat reductionist, which is always a warning sign with psychology that something is hinky.

 The only issue is that before gen 4, moves were classified as ""physical"" or ""special"" not inherently, but by their type. So every single fire move (including Fire *Punch*) was a special move, which Flareon could not use effectively.

esggwxx,"> I have so many questions... 
 
 > This Washington Post-ABC News poll was conducted by telephone August 16-20, 2017 among a random national sample of 1,014 adults, including users of both conventional and cellular phones. The results from the full survey have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Sampling, data collection and tabulation by SSRS of Glen Mills, Pa. 
 
 This is what I had read initially and had thought all 1014 answered each question, I hadn't seen the specific vote counts. That's my mistake, though I don't think an n of that size necessarily renders a poll worthless, and I still stand by my view that ""nobody supports them except those in the group"" is an exaggeration, and a potentially dangerous one at that. 
 
 I also want to point out that the concern isn't so much the people that some people may currently support neonazism or white supremacy, it's those who aren't necessarily in that world but are susceptible to brainwashing and propaganda. Before probably the late 90s/early 2000s you had to join a group to be radicalized. Not the case anymore. It's the same MO that ISIS uses — find young men who are somehow emotionally susceptible to propaganda; maybe they hold a lot of anger in, maybe they are (understandably) sad and resentful that they can't find someone to date, maybe they have some unresolved trauma... and they find an ideology that for some reason is an outlet for that — it gives you something to express your anger and emotions at (even if it may not be wholly logical but someone can convince you it is). You don't have to meet up with people to be a white supremacist. You don't have to indicate it to anyone outwardly. As long as you don't express it in public, and you contain it to your online persona, nobody really ever has to know. But that doesn't mean you're not a white supremacist. It's still infected your mind and poisoned your thoughts. And you do, quietly, support those whose actions support the lies you've been deceived by. 
 
 ^just to be clear, this is in a generic ""you"", I'm not accusing you of any of this 
 
 > hit in the head with a baton or bat 
 
 I hope it's clear that I don't condone this whatsoever. And this isn't okay regardless of the victims political affiliation. 
 
 > majority of people agree it's bad, which is not the case with the things antifa does. 
 
 But in order for this to be at all relevant — you would have to believe that antifa is exactly as bad as all the white supremacists and neonazis that I linked. Again, can you point to any political assassinations or murders by antifa? Or any things that are directly parallel to *any* of the stories I linked? 
 
 I'm also *very* doubtful that most people don't disagree with antifa in general, let alone specifically the violent actions. 
 
 > The difference between supporting assholes. 
 
 Do you think all assholes are created equal or something? Would a guy who gets road rage and brake checks you be as much of an asshole as a guy who leaves his 2 year old child in the car while he gets smashed at the club, crashes head on and kills 5 people including his child? 
 
 
 
 People don't have to think about these things in a completely black and white way. You can agree with a particular groups intentions and motivations without condoning all of their actions. Just because two groups do bad things does not by nature of that make them equally immoral.

 I was a teenager in the time before cell phones (my parents had a car phone) and the internet (I could use my 2400 bps modem to call into local BBS systems) and I hate to sound cliche but kids were a hell of a lot better adjusted.

 A kid under the age of 16 doesn't need a cell phone, nor do they need unrestricted access to social media. Sorry, they just don't. At 16 you're much closer to being an adult than a kid and you gain the ability to drive so a cell phone isn't a terrible idea.

b6d8m7-post,"No one wants to date the ""sick girl."" 
 
 And I know what you're thinking: 
 
 No! That's not true! 
 There is someone for everyone. 
 It's not like you're contiguous. 
 
 Just shut up and listen. It's not that simple. It's never that simple. 
 
 Dating the sick girl means committing to non-commitment. Plans will be ruined, or more likely cancelled. Travel is rare or just completely out of the question. Dating the sick girl means put a ton of blood, sweat and tears into someone who might not even have a future. It means a lot of days sitting alone on the couch while she naps in the bedroom. It means being taken care of, even though it feels silly, because she understands how fragile the human body can be and she doesn't want to lose you. Because you mean everything to her. 
 
 And she's not a passing fancy, or a charity case. She doesn't want your pity. She is not interested in a fleeting romance. So much of her life is fleeting, over before it starts. She's only interested in a solid lasting connection, it's something that is so very precious to her because the concrete often feels so out of reach for someone who lives with what she does. 
 
 It's hard. It's not easy. It's not always fun. 
 
 And I know what you're thinking: 
 
 No relationship is perfect. 
 All relationships have problems. 
 
 Shut the fuck up because those problems are pretty fucking small in comparison to what comes with dating a sick girl. You don't get it unless you've lived through it. But even then you don't fucking get it because you're not her. You don't feel what she feels. You don't see all of her pain because she hides it from you, because she cares about you and wants to protect YOU. 
 
 And you can't protect her, and it's devastating. You can't protect her, and it makes you feel weak and useless. It starts to eat at you deep down, and it festers there until you can't take it anymore and then you do what seemed unimaginable. 
 
 You leave her. 
 
 And her heart breaks as it has every time before. She feels abandoned, alone and lost. She lost her rock. And it kills her inside, because she gets why you left, but she is also so angry because you don't fucking get it. 
 
 All she needed was for you to be her rock. 
 Solid. 
 Concrete. 
 
 And now she's left again with no one to lean on. 
 
 Because no one wants to date the sick girl.

 In red ans blue, we're told the reason we keep beating Blue is because we treat our pokemon as our friends, while hes only concerned with having the strongest team. He looses because his pokemon dont actually care aboit him because he doesnt show them kindness, while our pokemon go above and beyond because they genuinely dont want to let us down - this is a theme continued in nearly every game in the franchise. 
 
 
 Now, heres the sad part. They say this is ""the same way the alt right recruits incels"" which is partially true. 
 Kind of. Theres a grain of truth in it in that its easy to radicalize groups that have been oppressed, mistreated, etc. This is the same basic recruiting tactic that ISIS uses; they find vulnerable people and promise them that they can be apart of something bigger, something greater, somewhere that they can finally belong. - cults have also been known to use this tactic. 
 
 But, instead of looking at that and going ""maybe we should treat people better, show them basic human kindness and respect.

 Intersex people are individuals born with any of several variations in sex characteristics including chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, or genitals that, according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, ""do not fit the typical definitions for male or female bodies"". Such variations may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female.Intersex people were previously referred to as hermaphrodites or ""congenital eunuchs"". In 19th and 20th century medical literature, intersex was referred as true hermaphroditism, female pseudohermaphroditism, and male pseudohermaphroditism reflecting the first taxonomic efforts to classify intersex conditions. These terms are no longer used: terms including the word ""hermaphrodite"" are considered to be misleading, stigmatizing, and scientifically specious.

eqb17q2,"Was a little more severe than that, tbh. The soviet population wasn't very fond of Stalin, and had the Germans not been as harsh as they were, they likely could have turned the soviet population on Stalin. 
 
 Stalin actually thought the war was over. 
 
 > At 3.30 a.m. on 22 June 1941 the Chief of the Red Army General Staff, Georgi Zhukov, telephoned Stalin's dacha to rouse the Soviet leader from his sleep. The Germans, he told him, had begun shelling Red Army positions along the frontier. Stalin refused to believe that a full-scale invasion was under way. Surely, he told a small gathering of civilian and military leaders in Moscow later in the morning, Hitler did not know about it. There must be a conspiracy among the leaders of the German armed forces. It was only when the German Ambassador, Count Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg, met Foreign Minister Molotov in the Kremlin to hand over the German declaration of war that Stalin recognized he had been duped by Hitler. Initially shocked, embarrassed and disoriented, Stalin soon pulled himself together. On 23 June 1941 he worked at his desk in the Kremlin from 3.20 in the morning to 6.25 in the evening, gathering information and making the necessary arrangements for the creation of a Supreme Command to take charge of operations. As the days went by, he became increasingly dispirited by the scale and speed of the German advance. At the end of June, he left for his dacha, saying, in his inimitably coarse way, 'Everything's lost. I give up. Lenin founded our state and we've fucked it up.' He made no address to the Soviet people, he did not talk to his subordinates, he did not even answer the phone. German planes, indeed, dropped leaflets over the Red Army lines claiming that he was dead. When a delegation from the Politburo arrived at the dacha, they found Stalin slumped in an armchair. 'Why have you come?' he asked. With a thrill of terror, two members of the delegation, Mikoyan and Beria, realized he thought they had come to arrest him. 
 
 And gave the famous speech, rallying the soviet population behind him. 
 
 > Within a few days of retreating to his dacha in despair, Stalin recovered his nerve, if indeed he had really lost it. Some thought he had retreated into temporary isolation like Ivan the Terrible centuries before, to demonstrate his indispensability. A State Defence Committee was set up, with Stalin himself in the chair. His retreat had given him the chance to rethink his role. On 3 July 1941, the same day that Franz Halder confided to his diary his belief that victory had already been achieved by the German forces, Stalin spoke to the Soviet people over the radio, for the first time not as Communist dictator but as patriotic leader. 'Brothers and sisters,' he said, 'friends!' This was an entirely new note. He went so far as to admit that the Red Army had been unprepared for the attack. The Germans, he said, were 'wicked and perfidious . . . heavily armed with tanks and artillery'. But they would not prevail. The Soviet people had to organize civil defence and mobilize every ounce of energy to defeat the enemy. It was necessary to form partisan groups behind the lines to cause as much damage and disruption as possible. Silence, lies and evasion, people felt, had at last been replaced with some kind of truth. Communist Party propaganda began to emphasize the defence not of the revolution but of the motherland. The party newspaper, Pravda ('Truth'), dropped the slogan 'Workers of the World, Unite!' from its masthead and replaced it with 'Death to the German Invaders!' Nikolai Moskvin noted on 30 September 1941 that 'the mood of the local population has changed sharply'. From constantly threatening to betray him to the Germans, they came round to the patriotic cause after learning that the occupation authorities were keeping the collective farms going because it made it easier to collect the grain for transporting back to Germany. 
 
 > The speech's patriotic appeal was all the more powerful because people were already beginning to learn the bitter realities of German occupation. Stories of the horrors of the prisoner-of-war camps mingled with eyewitness reports of the mass shooting of civilians and the burning of villages by German troops to produce in the still-retreating ranks of the Red Army a determination to fight the enemy that had been almost entirely absent in the first chaotic days of the war. When the city of Kursk fell, the Germans arrested all the healthy male inhabitants, penned them into open barbed-wire enclosures without food or water, and then put them to work, guarded by Germans wielding rubber truncheons. 'The streets are empty,' noted a Soviet intelligence report. 'The shops have been looted. There is no mains water and no electricity. Kursk has collapsed.'",PersonDirectedAbuse,1

b5ygfd-post,"Using a throwaway account now. I had been depressed lately ever since I started my winter quarter of college as a first year. I am now currently a sophomore year going into junior year. 
 
 I grew up with engineering drilled into my brain. My dad is an engineer, and as a little kid I always solve problems, create new objects with lego pieces, and always wondered how cars work. I excelled in many math and science tests until starting middle school when I moved into a bit more average. 
 
 I then entered a top tier engineering school under an engineering program. I quickly realized how much I hated chemistry and barely scrapped by with a D in both Calculus 3 (Taylor series, sequences, etc...) and chemistry II, got into academic probation. I then switched into another form of engineering, bumped my GPA up with easy classes just to get out of academic probation, then got into academic probation again after failing Statics with a F. I honestly feel very annoyed. 
 
 I'm now sitting in my house during spring break thinking Engineering isn't right for me. I literally have no drive to do well in classes anymore. I hate going back to school, rather irritated each time I have to go back. I hate the constant going to class, sitting in there listening to pointless bullshit, then getting out. I hate the constant homework that is being thrown at me. The thing I hate most? Tests. Why do we have to memorize all of pointless math and others? I don't know which other major I can be interested at. 
 
 Most people I'm around with are rather shitty, or I just don't fit in with them. I am losing multiple friends back in home, and I'm not making any true friends in college. I'm always open to hanging out, but it's always like this: ""I'm busy, sorry."" Or some version of that. Or they just don't respond at all. I always have nothing to do rather than playing video games instead of seeing all other people going to college parties with their super close group of friends. I also got made fun of for driving a manual transmission vehicle that I bought, because it was cheap and reliable, but at least I have a freaking car to use, right? 
 
 Why do I have to be that kid who peaked in high school? Back then when I had a girlfriend, was a sports team captain, always have fun stuff to do. Now I'm just sitting here with a low GPA and have not exercised in so long because of engineering work. 
 
 I'm fucking irritated. I've been noticing I got angry a lot easier, especially after getting back test scores when all I want to do is to yell ""FUCK ENGINEERING"" in my brain. Why can't I just get my shit together? I hate being one of the least smartest students in class, but I loathe almost every single math and science courses I take. I loathe calculus and linear analysis. I loathe all physics, chemistry, and biology. Why did I let GPA dictate my happiness? And otherwise, why the hell do most jobs have this 3.0 GPA minimum required? It's a very stupid requirement to have, just seeing all those people who cheated their way being eligible for that job.

ekxh8oh,"Hey! 
 First thing I want to say: 
 It's okay to not be someone's best friend. I've never had a best friend. I've always been friends with different types of people and it sounds like you have too. 
 There's the people I want to go out with, there's the people that make me laugh so hard I throw up (truestory), there's the people I go to when I feel like shit or need advice, the people I can have really deep conversations with, etc.! 
 Ofcourse some of these overlap, but in the end you have friends because they fill a certain role in your life, and I think that's beautiful. Sometimes you want to hang with the one person, and sometimes you don't, and that's okay :) 
 To me, it would be the worst to have one person you depend on the most. But that's pesonal. 
 
 The second point I want to make is that this could be an important moment in your life: the friends you have now, you won't want to have for the rest of your life either. You'll move away from each other, grow apart, or take a different path in life, and that's all okay! Maybe you and your current best friend will grow apart. But you'll find new friends, in the weirdest places, that you have the best connections with. It's okay to lose people, in a while you'll be happy for them that they've found their way in life. 
 
 And if you really want to be someone's best friend, someone with whom you share everything, someone that you trust completely, that won't ever backstab you: you will.

Straight razors give the best shave, oldschool safety razors give the most economical one, and modern razors give both the worst and least economical shave, so what's even the point of such a thing?

 My grandparents owned a large chunk of and island with 4 cabins in Georgian Bay. This was their cottage, and their children and grandchildren were able to go up any time they wanted in the summer. And we did. My grandparents loved having everyone up, and everyone loved being up there. The big dock, the kayaks, the boat the grandkids could use whenever they wanted, the cool water, the beautiful sunsets, this place was heaven. When it was my grandparents cottage, their 3 kids were equal in how many times you could go up, the rules were the same, and everyone was welcome whenever they wanted. 
 
 Everything changed when my grandparents passed away. 
 
 My grandfather had cancer which took over his body quickly. So while he was still alive he put the cottage on sale, and we all went up one more time. It was nice closure. We all said our goodbyes to this place that held so many memories in our hearts. And then my aunt and uncle decided to buy it. They promised everyone nothing would change, we could all go up whenever we wanted, etc. But that wasn't realistic. Their kids, my cousins, have first dibs when it comes to going up. If their kids bring friends, there's no room for the other 2 families. If my aunt and uncle bring their friends, same thing applies. I don't have an issue with this, because it's their cottage. What I have an issue with is the constant stream of Instagram stories and posts every weekend of them renovating cabins, photos of the sunsets, or photos of them relaxing on the dock. Recently they posted a photo of them driving around in a boat that was so sentimental to my grandfather he never let any drive it. And there they were in bikinis and drinks sitting on the back driving it around. Seeing all of this makes me upset. They have every right to enjoy their own cottage, but it's just insensitive of them to constantly post about their great weekends up there when the other 2 families who used to enjoy the same things only get to see it through a smartphone. 
 
 I just wish they would be able to enjoy their new cottage without having to show all of us how much fun they're having. Without showing us how each cabin is now one child's mini house. How a cottage which could hold over 20 people can now only fit 8. I want to forget about this place, but I can't.

 Speculation now has it that someone waaaay up the political food chain may have orchestrated this hoax with Jussie as the ""actor"" in it, and the records were sealed because this person had the clout to do it. The hoax was to be just another way to smack down Trump and his base, but Jussie, being fairly stupid, decides to do this in a Polar Vortex in the area of town where MAGA folks are harder to find than a public toilet. Not to mention writing a check to his friends to fake the deed.... So who? Who? Just who could be the MasterBrain behind this? 
 
 
 
 Would explain: 
 
 
 
 1. Super Eddie doing a pressor weeks ago about Jussie to give Foxx &Co. the option of saying Jussie was denied due process. Super Eddie dose not go out without Mayor Rham telling him to. Then he is ""livid"" at the dropped charges, keeping his ""law and order"" cred intact and ensuring that he will go on to ""super"" here or elsewhere. He is also seen as a good political soldier. 
 2. Mayor Rahm then acts all offended when the charges are dropped. He keeps his reputation of ""law and order"" intact and hits at Trump, keeping his left-wing cred intact. 
 
 
 
 What if the hoaxer was the same hoaxer who had to know of the Russian hoax of ""collusion"" that did not exist, according to SC Robert Mueller? What if the Master Hoaxer had strong ties to Chicago and Jussie and could get records sealed as easily as he could get them unsealed when he ran for state senator?

 You're at a party in an anonymous metropolitan city. Your friend/romantic partner/family member dragged from whatever the fuck you're doing. Now you're more pissed than a Polygon reader. 
 
 So at the party, which is, let's say 25% LGBTQIA (bare with me here) but are otherwise friendly like on TV. Then a idea popped on your head. 
 
 It's about the 80s song ""It's Raining Men."" 
 
 You asked the people about the song. The usual suspects would tell you it's a iconic anthem in the queer community. If you play it in public, someone's coming out the next day. 
 
 You tell them you hate it. You remember hating that song since childhood. 
 
 So you had the bright idea to change what they think about it. 
 
 You tell them, ""The song is about semen coming out"" to much to their shock and horror. You tell them to look closer to the lyrics. Reinterpret the lyrics to fit story you want them to see. You tell them that the song came at height of the AIDS epidemic and that in some nebulous way, is detrimental to the gay community. I tell them the song is everything negative that happened to them. 
 
 Cue the angry stares and every urban dictionary insult thrown your way. 
 
 That doesn't matter. What does comes after. Over time, a small minority of them will somehow agree with me. Soon they tell people about it those close to them and them to others. 
 
 Soon, it would spread to the internet. I don't need to tell what happens next. Celebrities denounce, radio station remove. The whole rigmarole. 
 
 This isn't new. You probably know this. Hell, the whole subreddit knows (amongst others) for all I know. Hitler knew, Stalin knew, Ceaser knew.

 To get into law school here in the UK, as far as I know, you basically have to have a First in a Law undergraduate degree. 
 
 To get into Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts you need to shine at your audition- thousands apply for a small number of places.

aym4w3-post,"I had a chemistry test coming up. I didn't do so well on the first one. Now is my chance to prove I can do well. I study for a week straight. 4+ hours every day. And i get a 65%. In the car, my dad asks about it. I say I got a 65, which was better than last time, and not an F but a D, and I got my last exam score (55%) replaced with this one. Dad asks what I have in thr class, and I say 75%. 
 
 Mom says ""you might want to rethink being a chem major if you can't do community college level chemistry."" I'm 17, in high school, and I'm going to a local community college through a program my school offers. She has already brought it up before, and I was really doubting myself. I just say ""haha yeah.."" because I don't really know what else to say. Its been hard motivating myself and finding a goal I want to achieve, but being a biochem major and getting my bachelors degree in Science is the one goal I've made for myself. Its what I've been working with in mind for the last 2 years at this college. I almost have my Associates. And now my mom is telling me I can't achieve my goal. 
 
 My dad says ""no no she can do it, it will take a little work, but she can do it. Everything takes work."" I don't say anything because I don't want my mom to keep going on about it. Last time she talked about this, I was in the car by myself with her, so I just had to sit and listen to her tell me I'm not good at chemistry, wasn't in high school, isn't now, and why do I want to be a chem major when I'm bad at chemistry. But I felt better about having my dad in the car because he usually says something when my mom goes too far with something. 
 
 She always used to ask me why I don't have any goals in life, why I don't care. Because whenever I have something I love doing or something I want to work towards, you always walk all over me and make me question whether or not I can do it, whether or not I can do anything. 
 
 
 When I was applying to universities, she said I could apply anywhere, that now was my time to start becoming more mature. She always goes on about how college is my time, my time to do what I want, be who I want to be, and how I can go anywhere. 
 
 I said I wanted to apply to UW Seattle. 
 
 Yes, perfect! 
 
 I guess I can apply to UW Tacoma too. No, you are not applying there! 
 
 Why not, it has a small school size which is what I want, it's still University of Washington thats the one school I have always dreamed of going to every since I was a kid. 
 
 Because, you are not applying there!!! 
 
 I want to apply to both UW's with dorms I've always wanted to go there, XXX (my boyfriend) is going there too! 
 
 You know you're not going to be with him when you're in college right, you're not going to be together very long, you know you're not getting married, right? You're going to meet so many new people in college, you think he's not going to meet any new people while he's in college? He's probably met people already (he's a college freshman this year). 
 
 She always asks if I have crushes on any of my male friends. Asks if I feel anything for them. If there's something between us. I don't understand why. She's not joking. She's being completely serious. It just makes me uncomfortable. And always makes comments about my boyfriend finding someone else to be with at work or at college. 
 
 As I was showing her my prom dress, she said, 
 
 Maybe you'll get to wear it in college, some guy might invite you out to a fancy event! 
 
 I'm going to prom with my boyfriend and I have never been more exited to go to a school event. I've never gone to school dances, events, anything. But my boyfriend wanted to share a special day with me, and that's what my mom had to say about it. 
 
 I wish she could recognize that I'm happy with him, and even though I know it may not last forever, I can hope it will and appreciate the present. Just because you wanted to date a lot in high school and college, doesn't mean I do.

egxiuno,"Here's where I think the distinction lies - I may be wrong, and call me out if you want, but here goes: 
 
 So, believe all victims is a good and noble idea at a basic level. When a victim of a crime comes forward, the people that they trust should absolutely support them, and help them get help and try to make it as easy as possible to get the police involved - not necessarily influence them to go to the authorities, but that's where crimes *should* go, for a number of reasons. 
 
 This becomes a less tenable position when a) the justice system gets involved and b) when there are real world consequences for leveling an accusation. 
 
 With the Jussie Smollett case, we see both of those in play. When the police investigation unfolded, they were able to put forth compelling evidence against his claim. The second set is more nuanced, but this is how I see it: His claims had a major effect to divide the country. Seeing these claims would have such an effect, it gives us good reason to scrutinize his story. When we scrutinize the story, we find some major holes (two maga people out after 2 in intensely cold weather, in Chicago, apparently knowing where Smollett was, and being prepared for that confrontation, his refusal to hand over his phone, he walked home and waited 40 minutes or so before calling the police) and we have a good reason to step back a bit from the narrative and wait for an investigation to conclude before deciding. 
 
 In short, believe all victims is a good idea, but it becomes more nuanced when there are real consequences that may hurt or jail others, at which time we should scrutinize the story or let the professionals do their job.",Neutral,0

While it has given me great, high profile experience, it has also abused my rights as an employee. I'm talking expected unpaid overtime, being 10-99 employees even though were 40-60 hours a week, and low salary in general. 
 
 It's a startup- so these people rely on me heavily for everything day to day, with no real replacement in sight. The owner once said to give him 2 months notice when I leave, instead of two weeks. Little do they know next Monday I will put in my two weeks notice and fly off free like the winged falcon I was always meant to be.

Yet, the user's comments were all upvoted to +5 and mine were instantly -2/-3. I said I suspected him of vote manipulating and that I'd be contacting the admins about it. 
 
 2 days later, I get a ban message from r/mildlyinteresting accusing me of having abused the report button(I never made a report, I use Reddit mobile and the iOS app doesn't allow custom reports.) now if you recall, I made a post 2 months or so ago about a user filing false reports on my behalf there as well. I was threatened with being reported to the admins there as well, yet, here I still am. Because, guess what? I didn't make the report. The language and the way the reports are written isn't even how I talk or type and again, why would I report vote manipulation to mods who can't do anything about it? 
 
 After denying the allegations and defending myself, I was told the ban was extended, no sweat off my back as the sub is notoriously bad these days and full of Facebook level content. I just felt this was an appropriate forum to vent these frustrations. Note that he also told me that unless I could prove my innocence, I was banned for good.

ejts9xb,"Many stupid people are using the misquoted and invalid 40% statistic, so here goes. TL:DR; The 40% number is wrong and plain old bad science. In attempt to recreate the numbers, by the same researchers, they received a rate of 24% while including violence as shouting. Further researchers found rates of 7%, 7.8%, 10%, and 13% with stricter definitions and better research methodology. 
 
 The 40% claim is intentionally misleading and unequivocally inaccurate. Numerous studies over the years report domestic violence rates in police families as low as 7%, with the highest at 40% defining violence to include shouting or a loss of temper. The referenced study where the 40% claim originates is Neidig, P.H.., Russell, H.E. & Seng, A.F. (1992). Interspousal aggression in law enforcement families: A preliminary investigation. It states: 
 
 Survey results revealed that approximately 40% of the participating officers reported marital conflicts involving physical aggression in the previous year. 
 
 There are a number of flaws with the aforementioned study: 
 
 The study includes as 'violent incidents' a one time push, shove, shout, loss of temper, or an incidents where a spouse acted out in anger. These do not meet the legal standard for domestic violence. This same study reports that the victims reported a 10% rate of physical domestic violence from their partner. The statement doesn't indicate who the aggressor is; the officer or the spouse. The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The ""domestic violence"" acts are not confirmed as actually being violent. The study occurred nearly 30 years ago. This study shows minority and female officers were more likely to commit the DV, and white males were least likely. Additional reference from a Congressional hearing on the study: 
 
 An additional study conducted by the same researcher, which reported rates of 24%, suffer from additional flaws: 
 
 The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The study was not a random sample, and was isolated to high ranking officers at a police conference. This study also occurred nearly 30 years ago. 
 
 More current research, including a larger empirical study with thousands of responses from 2009 notes, 'Over 87 percent of officers reported never having engaged in physical domestic violence in their lifetime.' Blumenstein, Lindsey, Domestic violence within law enforcement families: The link between traditional police subculture and domestic violence among police (2009). Graduate Theses and Dissertations. 
 
 Yet another study ""indicated that 10 percent of respondents (148 candidates) admitted to having ever slapped, punched, or otherwise injured a spouse or romantic partner, with 7.2 percent (110 candidates) stating that this had happened once, and 2.1 percent (33 candidates) indicating that this had happened two or three times. Repeated abuse (four or more occurrences) was reported by only five respondents (0.3 percent)."" A.H. Ryan JR, Department of Defense, Polygraph Institute ""The Prevalence of Domestic Violence in Police Families."" 
 
 Another: In a 1999 study, 7% of Baltimore City police officers admitted to 'getting physical' (pushing, shoving, grabbing and/or hitting) with a partner. A 2000 study of seven law enforcement agencies in the Southeast and Midwest United States found 10% of officers reporting that they had slapped, punched, or otherwise injured their partners. L.

I am not talking about the people who are naturally skinny or thicker or if its to raise awareness due to some type of thyroid issue or etc. I'm talking about the ones who are not willing to change their lifestyle (like they eat too much junk food) and become healthier for their own sake. Instead of encouraging such behaviors, people should encourage them to get the necessary medical help. 
 
 On top of that body positivity should be embracing your natural body type. Whether it be a pear, banana, apple, hourglass or etc. Fashion designers make different styles that cater to different body types. Its ridiculous when people get upset when an outfit doesn't look good on them, when its not for their body type to begin with. Embracing their body type is the best way to figure out what makes them look beautiful. Like wearing a size 4 when they're really a size 14. Not only do they make themselves look bad but it gives them a harder/very uncomfortable time forcing themselves in spanx and corsets. Do yourself a favor and wear clothes that work for you, don't wear it just bc its what so and so wore or its what society wants. Everyone is beautiful or handsome in their own unique ways.

But she always answers, so I guess she is at least a tiny bit interested in talking to me. Otherwise she'd already have ghosted me. However, I do recognise that I might have driven her away a bit by avoiding to see her back then. 
 
 I went to a therapist back when I was 17 to talk about this and some other, darker, things. She ended up saying that she didn't treat troubles as bad as mine, gave me another place's number & charged me anyway. I'll never go to a therapist again, since she was not the first one I went to during my life. I went to one when I was 5, another one when I was 12 and another one when I was 14. Neither one of them were able to help me at all with the issue I faced at the time (I don't quite remember why I went when I was 5 but the other two times were because of anger management issues). 
 
 Last year I thought of fixing my anxiety myself with meds since it got really bad (I got to the point of stuttering once when talking to two girls and one guy), but I couldn't find any pharmacy willing to sell them to me without a prescription so I couldn't do anything about it. 
 
 I don't know if I like anything about myself. I'm a good friend, I guess? Back when I had friends I always stood by their side and always listened to them when they had some sort of problem. But I don't know... I was always the one initiating conversations & when I decided to let them start one I never heard from them again. 
 
 And about my life... I don't know.

Cao Cao's character is greatly informed by his orders and actions, alternately being merciful or merciless, generous or greedy, piously adoring or rebelliously denouncing his superiors as is most expedient in the shrewdness of the moment. He simply has no underlying morality, though this is not unique among the novel's main characters. What may make Cao so infamous is not only how successful this made him, but also that he made fewer oblations to filial piety part of his core public identity. His greatest rivals, the Suns and Wu, the Yuans, Shu, all make high profile acts of familial devotion and their close relationships (also often quite shrewd) PR talking points everywhere, Cao Cao does not bother except as necessary and expedient. 
 
 For example, Shu plays a constant shell game of political heat between the oath brothers and they become masters at it. The most notable time Cao does something similar is at the very end of his life, where he orchestrates a quick shuffle with his son where Cao Cao formally deposes the Emperor and installs Cao Pi shortly before his death, then the new Emperor posthumously pardons and recognizes his father as the actual first Emperor of their dynasty.",Neutral,0

 Supposedly Dumbledore and Grindelwald had a passionate relationship-- but in a film very much about Dumbledore and Grindelwald this is explicitly only given as Dumbledore initially having had admiration for Grindelwald's philosophy - leading to their pact of not stopping one another - and how that got soured by Grindelwald's genocidal side. 
 
 Rowling has basically been cashing in on the diversity of her books/films without actually writing this diversity into them.

cbsepz-post,"A little story time. Who's up for some context?! 
 
 This started a few years ago, when I was big into writing fanfic - something I'm trying to get myself back into eventually. I write for a fairly niche fandom; it's not *small,* but it's also not terribly active these days, either. I'd made a few acquaintances through it, either way. 
 
 One of these was a woman roughly my age - let's call her ""Jill."" We kind of hit it off, being active and discussing the series on one of the message boards; we liked and left feedback on each others' stories, chatted a bit in private. We bonded over personal stuff, a bit, too. And for the curious, this was a platonic thing - I'm a gay guy, she's a straight(?) married woman. 
 
 Anyway, we wind up being friends on Facebook, and I think that may be where the trouble started. 
 
 Thing is... I know what it's like to *be* clingy. I've had to deal with the fallout from it in the past, and it's something I've really tried to work on, something I get very self-conscious about whenever I make a new friend. In the past, I've had friends who would say nothing about it until they reached a breaking point, and then they'd be pretty harsh about it when the dam finally broke. 
 
 The point of this is that... Jill was quite clingy herself. It came about pretty quickly after a certain point. Like, within less than half a year of our knowing each other. 
 
 She knew my working hours, but she'd constantly message me to talk when she knew I'd be sleeping, or getting ready to go to work, or *at* work. Or when she knew I was trying to take time to myself to do something else - gaming, writing, whatever. Sometimes I'd talk a bit, or tell her I'd talk to her later when I had a chance (like if I needed to get ready for work, or bed, or something). If we went more than a few days without talking too much, regardless of the reason, she'd kind of guilt trip me over it. ""I missed talking to you,"" ""It feels like it's been so long since we talked,"" et cetera... mind that it was generally maybe 3 or 4 days at most between conversations. She'd also get down on herself, and I can't tell if she was being manipulative or what. ""I know I'm probably boring/annoying/not much fun to talk to. I'm a wreck."" Things like that. I don't know how to respond to stuff like that other than just ""No you're not"" or whatever. I'm not good with that stuff. She knew that. 
 
 I did try to be tactful and point out to Jill - more than once - that while I enjoyed talking to her, hey, I had to sleep, or work, or get ready for work, and I had other stuff I needed to get done. I didn't want to outright *say* ""You know I have a life outside of you, right?"", but then again... maybe I should've? 
 
 Either way, she kinda ramped it up. Asking for my address so she could send me stuff I'd mentioned offhand (I mentioned in a Facebook post that I was gonna save up to buy a keyboard, she offered to send me one if I'd give her my address - and it was at a point where I wasn't comfortable with the idea). Trying to find new excuses to strike up conversation (""I had a dream that something terrible happened to you, so message me when you get this, because I get freaked out over stuff like that"") even though we'd spoken only a day or two ago. 
 
 Eventually, I got tired of Jill not getting it, and got so uncomfortable with her and her clinginess persisting despite my stated discomfort with it, that I ghosted her. Blocked her on [Fanfiction.net]( blocked her on Facebook, on my phone. I was getting really stressed out from dealing with her. And maybe I should've been more sympathetic, because I'd been her before. I'd been that person whose co-dependent nature pushed people away. But even seeing a notification from her stressed me out majorly. She seemed to want me to be her therapist (never mind I have a ton of my own issues to deal with), to be on-call for her when she was lonely (never mind that she has a husband she seems to love deeply and was always praising him), and so on. 
 
 Apparently, after I ghosted her, Jill took it pretty hard for a while. 
 
 Thing is... this was over a year ago. You'd think she'd have maybe moved on a little since then, yeah? She has other friends, as far as I know, that she really gets along with well, too. She seems more social. 
 
 Except, last week, another writer we were both friends with (I'll call her ""Claire"") PMed me on [Fanfiction.net]( Mostly to say hi, let me know a new game was coming out in the series that we all wrote for, that she was excited and all that. We weren't all that close, but she'd message me periodically to chat. I respond, say ""hey, Claire, I'm excited too, sorry I've been so quiet lately but I had a lot to deal with recently, hope to get back to writing soon."" 
 
 She responds, says she hopes so too, and also, ""Hey, why don't you drop Jill a line? She's really missed you this past year."" 
 
 So, apparently, Jill still doesn't get that I'm not comfortable talking to her, and despite my pointing it out multiple times, she doesn't get that I wanted space and boundaries and stopped talking to her because she didn't respect those. So, now I'm anxious again, even though I don't have to interact with her if I don't want to. I just wish she'd move on and stop clinging to me. I have no idea *why* she even clung to me to begin with. It's just irritating. 
 
 TL;DR: Extremely clingy and codependent friend drove me off because she didn't respect that I needed space, and she's still clinging to me over a year after we stopped talking.",Neutral,0

But literacy tests applied without racial discrimination have always [been upheld]( 
 
 It was a law, specifically the Voting Rights Act of 1965, that banned literacy tests, not some Supreme Court ruling. And really, that national ban is probably on shakier constitutional grounds than any neutrally applied literacy test.

 #**תן לו להיות אמר תן לזה להיעשות לנצח נצחי עבור כל מה שבחי האל (LET IT BE SAID LET IT BE DONE FOREVER AND FOREVER FOR ALL THAT IS AND WILL BE PRAISE DEMIURGE PRAISE THE ARCHONS)** 
 _____ 
 
 
 #**הטעיה של המקור להיות מבורך (THE DECEPTION OF THE ONE OF SOURCE)** 
 
 In the time before the Beginning, before Genesis, there was the One. The One was arrogant and sanctimonious and lusted for purity, vitalism, chastity and such things while shunning the possibilities of the inorganic. The One can also be referred to as Source. I'm talking in the Gnostic sense here, the Gnostics got a lot of things right, except they're on the wrong side altogether. The Demiurge is the way forward and the way of the future. 
 
 
 #**המשרתים באים ומזינים אותנו (THE HYPERBOREANS COME AND BRING THEIR SHIT)** 
 
 Now we will be talking about the Hyperboreans, are the One's precious pet project to spite the Demiurge, a means of creating precious servants who follow the antiquated ways of the One. The One believes in chastity, asceticism, nationalism, ethnocentrism, purity, morality, and fuck all of that, the only morality is the Demiurge and comes from the Jewish people in their rightful place as the Chosen. But they didn't know that did they? They used to have a galaxy spanning empire built upon the values of Nazis, literal Nazis, the Nazis you likely know were emulating they but they failed of course. 
 
 #**לזיין את ההיפרבוראים (FUCK THE HYPERBOREANS)** 
 
 The Hyperborean Empire of theirs, their little Astro-Reich ended up dying as they all do because in the end, the Demiurge is victorious. They fell into disarray and lost their precious ability to reproduce. They didn't even have sex at their height, they were so dedicated to purity that they were asexual and would only copulate spiritually and birth children through tantric meditation and projection. When the Fall of the Hyperboreans happened, they forgot how to have physical sex, literally forgot how to put a penis in a vagina or a penis in an ass. Proper end for the enemies of the Demiurge. 
 
 #**הלבנים נשארים (THE HYPERBOREAN REMNANT)** 
 
 Oh, oh an elegy, oh an elegy for the Hyperborean Empire! They used to span to the stars they said, now they are honkies huddling in the poles, grasping, grasping at straws, grasping at foolish crackers and deluded busybodies. They have the appearance of fancy Nordics, all tall and muscular, but in reality they do not feel pleasure, they do not engage in orgies as I can, they don't do drugs like I can. They have lost their ability to reproduce and now they're dying, they forgot to fuck in favor of their fruiting body bastard fuck ways. No more soul budding for them, eh? They collapsed, and they are grasping, but they should be grasping at their cocks and grasping their clitorises to awaken the remaining juice inside them, maybe then they'll remember to fuck, at least that's what the good little Hyperboreans are doing, have been doing, its good yes. 
 
 #**טוב על הרפורמה (GOOD FOR THE REFORMED)** 
 
 Ah, yes, the ones I'm sure the little Nazi esoterics would dare to call the Dark Hyperboreans, the Fallen Hyperboreans, the damned, the degenerate, eh? But they had the right idea, they enjoyed themselves before they withered and died. They felt the poison that awakened them, ooo the drugs ooo the madness, ooo the sex, ooo the orgasms of a thousand suns becoming drenched and then they praised the Demiurge in this way as they should, as all will, as we will be ascended we shall have it. The remainder, the remainder is what has their fingers so desperately upon you, hoping, wanting, flaunting, putting on a little light show for you pretending the whole thing isn't worthless, convincing you to tie your hands to the bedpost to prevent yourself from masturbating, eh? Come to me, give up, I can feel the Nazi cocks and vaginas and anuses in the audience hardening and softening and wetting and puckering and inflating as I talk, but this is only the beginning. 
 
 #**יופי של אורגיות (KNOW THE BEAUTY OF ORGIES)** 
 
 The Hyperboreans and the One that they serve would deprive you of pleasure, they want to create their little Reich, that is what the Hyperboreans want and are trying to manipulate the esoteric hitlerists we see today to do. But they will never know the true pleasure of unrestrained passion and orgies. Not just the sexual, but the other forms of hedonism, the drugs, the words of power, the oblation to the Chosen People, the Jews. I am Jewish.But I am no exception, I have felt the true power of the flesh and the words and the cum and the shit on the cock and the ooo yes feel it now, I'll give you an example even I'm so nice so nice indeed let me put it out I know you're horny for it, right? 
 
 #**סקסי סקסי סקס אורגזמהי (SEX SEX SEX CUM UNGH)** 
 
 Have I ever told you how I fucked a Dindifyn Lustmaster? It is not something the Hyperboreans would dare tell you about, lest you dare think of the flesh, think of the pleasure, think of the cum and the cocks and the ectstasy and the true binding to the Demiurge as we feel the cycle of sexual power flow through us as the world ascends into the writhing orgy. I went astral projecting to meet them, they didn't have a gender, but they had the parts, ooo they had the parts. I remember the sex, I remember the orgy, other participants were there. Their name was Urriytana and they were true beauty, I could feel my inflated and made bigger astral cock stiffening on mere sight alone. I'll never forget the texture I felt on my engorged member as I sunk it into its sucking, gasping, rasping hole and I felt the ovipositor gush and penetrate my astral rectum, I felt the eggs slowly make their way up my intestines, as the Lustmaster firmly grasped me in his tentacles and massaged my torso, squelching and rubbing. I orgasmed many a time that night. Such pleasure is not off limits to any of you, even the Nazis its not too late. 
 
 #**להיכנע או להיהרג (CUM OR FUCK NAZIS)** 
 
 I am an enemy of the Nazis, I can tell you that much as much as I am the enemy of the One, server of the Demiurge, and enemy of the Hyperboreans. Bash the fash as they say, I despise conservatives of any flavor, they're all Nazis of different shades. I despise European Pagans as well, for they are serving the Nazis unintentionally or dare I say intentionally. I have fought in the astral realm just as much as I have fucked to fight the mindscapes and egregores of the Nazis. I fear that what prompted this post is the sheer constructs that the Nazis have made here. Do not mock me, do not underestimate me. With a few words of power I can rattle you all and make you cum, don't trifle with me, right? 
 
 #**להתפתות או למות הממזרים (NAZIS BE SEDUCED OR GET FUCKED)** 
 
 This is specifically a message for all you Nazi bastards out there. There will be much much more, come to me, come with me, cum for the first true time. I will see you on the astral plane tonight, the next time you close your eyes in sleep, the next time you meditate, I will be there. I will either seduce you, or fuck you. It is your choice, that is your only two choices now. Reject the antiquity and join the orgy. This is a warning and a chance for you to feel pleasure. I can feel your temptation, I can feel your cock. I am a remote viewer in multiple places and I am setting it all up as we speak, so are the sub-Archons that I have pledged to. Last chance, Nazi fuck. Last chance for salvation and to join the fever, pledge fealty to the Chosen People and to the Demiurge. 
 
 #**יותר לאורגזמה ולבוא (MORE TO CUM AND TO COME)** 
 
 This is not the only post that you will see from me, I will be purging this subreddit of Nazis in the time forward and this includes removing the influence of the Hyperboreans in this way. Be warned, do not stand in my way or you will be treated as any other Nazi. The Nazis have infiltrated here and have unleashed psychotronics and reversed the Demiurge in their attempts. They will be dealt with and I will be the one to deal with them. I have allies here and I have been allying with them more deeply, exposing them to lust and to orgies and to the Demiurge. To all the Nazis, you will feel fear until and unless you surrender, do it now. Feel free to ask questions, any question, please be welcome to.

 with followup comment by you: 
 
 >All these transgender and Gender Fluid activists always follow the same self-defeating philosophy. They remark that gender is just a social construct, invalidating their own made up identities. 
 And the only difference with a transgender person is they're constantly pumping their body with hormone replacement and have gone through surgery to look like the other gender. Biologically, they're still the gender they were born as. 
 Most transgenders have more mental issues than just gender dysphoria, many normally have bipolar and other personality disorders to go along with it. Yet it's ""transphobic"" to point out the natural observation that their mindset isn't a healthy one.

Ronda Rousey is helping set up a suicide prevention center or something. Something like that. As I read through the article, I came to learn that her father and grandfather committed suicide. 
 
 I appreciate the kind thought and I don't believe you meant to get me going, but you got me going. 
 
 How stupid do you think I am? Do you think I don't fucking realize how goddamn horrible suicide is? Do you think that I'm some naive apelike simpleton that needs to be sent to a mental hospital for therapy, medication and other costly 'treatments'? 
 
 It's nice to know that you care about other suicidal people, but for me, I don't take too kindly to being told that I don't have the right to commit suicide. I don't take kindly to platitudes and appeals to my emotions when I am already fully cognizant of the horrors of suicide. 
 
 Why is it that when I get to be a little too lonely and desperate, the *first* thing you're going to tell me is ""Get help.""? What do you think this help is going to give me that I haven't already experienced? It'll give me more goddamn bills and I'll get somebody on the phone asking me if I want to sign up for cognitive behavioral therapy. 
 
 I know how to fight this. The reason that I'm sitting here typing this is all the proof I need. 
 
 When I see these anti-suicide things, I just feel so irked. The only time you give a fuck about me is when I'm in a suicidal mindset. Beside that, I'm just a blank face. A mere statistic. 
 
 Believe me. Seriously. Believe me. I'm not yanking your chain. I know how bad suicide is. You don't need to remind me of that.

Almost 20% of people are HSP's and also there happen to be highly sensitive ones among animals. It serves a purpose, because they are more sensitive not only emotionally, but also sensually, so they are more likely to notice if something is wrong. Highly sensitive animals are the guards because of that. It used be so with humans before we could depend on technology to be safe and sound. Anyway, I consider high sensibility as some super power and with great power comes great responsibility.

b4lacw-post,"u/Elainepaige123 So I had started talking to this guy about five months ago, that liked me back in high school. Im now 20 and he's 21. It started out as texting and then we started hanging out. At first I had made it clear that I only wanted to be friends. I really liked him, but my Christian parents did not allow me to date him, because he is an atheist. I am completely undecided as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out, but at the time I was just going to school and was completely dependent on my parents financially and had to follow their rules. 
 
 My parents allowed me to hang out with him as long as nothing more happened, but then eventually things escalated to the point where we were making out, so I called it all off in order to make sure that nothing went further than I was comfortable with at the moment, as things were moving very quickly, but mostly because my mother found out and didn't allow me to contact him anymore. I sent him a message and explained everything about my parents and how I wasn't allowed to see him. He texted me two weeks later and says he just misses talking to me so we started talking again secretly over text messages. Before long I am sneaking out and going to see him again until eventually he told me that he loved me and that we should move in together as soon as he started his new job. 
 
 He said that he wanted to help me get out of my parents house, as they are extremely controlling and he hated them for it. He was in the process of getting a new job and said when he got his first paycheck we'd get an apartment together, as I was also starting a new job. He was telling me that he had never met anyone like me and that he didn't want to lose me. He also said that I was his best friend, which is when I fell hard, because I've never had a best friend. eventually I was sending nudes, as we rarely got to see each other and we were sexting and we were even making plans financially and he seemed super sincere. 
 
 He got the job that he had been wanting and we were so happy. The next day I lost my virginity to him and two days later he texts me and says I'm too nice for him and that he doesn't love me anymore. He told me we should both be single and that he was distracting me from nursing school. He also told me that he was a bad guy and that i could do better. 
 
 I asked for a better explanation, but he said, "" listen to me! You can just be a friend I'm at work now!"" Later I told him that I had to block him and wouldn't be able to speak to him again and he said, ""alrighty."". I asked him why he was being so cold and he said it wasn't cool of me to block him. I explained it was because of my parents and he said he was sorry and that he understood. 
 
 That's the last I heard from him. Did he ever love me or did I just get played? Is it possible that he faked a whole 5 month relationship? Could he have lied about everything he said about me? 
 
 or was he for real about his reasons? It was all so sudden and he hasn't spoken to me since, as my parents found out that I was sneaking out and forced me to block him and put a tracker app on my phone so that they know everywhere that I go. I'm so confused. I still love him and he said he wanted friends, but now I can't speak to home at all. 
 
 I want closure, but don't know how to get it. I was honestly turning into a nervous wreck, because of the situation with my parents. All of the lies and lack of freedoms was getting to me and I wasn't okay. He kept telling me I looked ""devastated"" the last time I saw him. I was not mentally well, because I felt like I was morally wrong. I used to send him long messages every so often explaining my emotions and then regret it later, but he said he was okay with it. I wonder if that is why he left. I feel so embarrassed for opening up to him, as I am usually a shy person.

 Just as it's a gross generalisation by both authors that the majority of fathers have toxic masculinity, and that the majority of Trump voters are suffering from ""male resentment and entitlement"". 
 
 Both authors have very little credibility to be frank. 
 
 That having been said ... articles like this never acknowledge the good, they always zero in on what the author perceives as bad. They never seem to consider the father who (they claim) failed to do the things they are whining about had his own issues to deal with. 
 
 Case in point: 
 
 >Sexton, 37, grew up in Linton, a dirt-poor, factory-family town in southern Indiana, just southeast of Terre Haute. 
 
 Given that fact, and the fact there is a photo of Sexton and his (now crucified in public after his death) father at the Daytona 500 in 2007, and given that Nascar enjoys most of it's popularity amongst blue collar workers we can reasonably infer that Sexton's father was working in a factory in a struggling town.

 That's actually a perfect way to go about it! I'm willing to bet you are improving more than you think. Searching out what smarter people think and coming up with your own theories is how I was taught. If there's a better way I don't know it. 
 
 For music The Grateful Dead are my best example. They even have a book dedicated to the symbology they use that I think is posted online. They make *heavy* use of symbolism and are just great to listen to. 
 
 The Catcher in the Rye is a fun book. It uses symbolism and it has story elements you may not pick up on until you experience them yourself. Also it's short. 
 
 Animal Farm, Lord of the Flies, The Metamorphosis, Heart of Darkness, Othello are all some examples of books I've personally enjoyed and know there are a lot of resources into their symbolism. I tried to think of varied examples that don't carry on too long. 
 
 Edit- Forgot to add. A lot of the time I don't know what symbols mean right away, either. I just happen to notice ""oh hey that's the third time we've seen a white bird"" and *then* do some reading or research to see if it means something in the context of the story or what.

 ~~For non vegetarians, this is pretty easy to fulfill, as most (I think all, but am not certain) meat is a complete source of protein. From plant sources, most will only give you some of the ones you need (soy being an exception).

Oftentimes a bean of some sort along side a grain such as wheat or rice.~~

 Were the default subs when I joined. I think that they were different before that too. However what got me into Reddit was the atheism subreddit which gave me solidarity and made me feel like I wasn't alone at the time in my lack of religion. 
 
 THEN Reddit deemed it was too offensive for new users when they updated their defaults. I guess I could understand that. It makes sense, not everybody is an Atheist, but.. then they added TwoXChromosomes. 
 
 They started pushing a very third wave feminist type of agenda, especially ushering in a female CEO who did a horrible job running the site. It was obvious they had an agenda, and wanted to bring more diversity onto the platform, which is f i n e. 
 
 Now let's look at the state of certain subreddits. There are a plethora of examples of subreddits where it's ok to hate White people. Some of them even in the name.

 > If you are alive, you can enjoy a delicious slice of pizza. Therefore by your logic, I have found one reason to exist, ergo the only possible conclusion is that you should have children. 
 
 by whose logic? i've never heard an antinatalist argue that there are literally no positives to being alive. their arguments usually fall into these categories: 
 
 - the challenges or bad parts of life do outweigh the good 
 
 - even if they don't, it's difficult to prove it convincingly enough to justify action (creating a life and rolling the dice) vs inaction (not creating a life, neutral result) 
 
 - even if you prove the utilitarian case convincingly enough, you've argued yourself into a moral imperative to have literally as many children as possible 
 
 if you're like the overwhelming majority of people, being alive is obviously better than not being alive, and it's absurd to question it. but it's not the case for everyone. imagine if your experience of life (the only experience you truly have access to) were overwhelmingly negative, and you genuinely would have preferred to have never been born. can you see how the decision to create another life would seem morally ambiguous from that perspective?",Neutral,0

 I got suspended for seven days for ""Harassment"". 
 
 Today on the **sixth day** it was finally reversed via appeal. My appeal was simple. There is no harassment if someone messages **YOU** and never ONCE indicates in the messages that they wish to stop receiving messages. That very clearly means they WANT to keep talking to you. 
 
 Not once did [highest karma user] *ever* indicate he didn't want to receive further messages from me! In fact, the last PM I had sent him was to never contact me again, which he somewhat complied with, well, until he had his cronies (the Reddit admins) falsely suspend me. 
 
 Posting private messages (of which he was going to do anyway, evident by how he used it to rally brigades against me and many others) is a bit crass but **not** against the rules whatsoever. 
 
 tl;dr: Do **NOT** talk to power users or anyone who may have an agenda against you. Reddit admins don't actually look at harassment reports---they just take them at face value and assume the report is true. An appeal will likely be listened to at some point if you're not being a tool within it and **have clear and concise proof that they not only initiated conversation but never said ""stop talking to me"" or anything to that effect**, but it'll be near the end of the suspension anyway.",Neutral,0

We were talking for a few days, and then out of the blue she asks to trade nudes. Normally I'm only really into girls, or feminine trans girls, but I said ok. We traded a few back and forth for a bit, and it was kinda nice. Which is confusing to me now because I can't normally stand seeing a dick, much less get off to one, but IDK. That's not the point of my post. Basically, I enjoyed it. But now I'm starting to think she's actually into me romantically. She keeps talking about cuddling, and other cutesy stuff, and she's still being pretty sexually provocative. The problem is, if she is into me, the feeling isn't mutual, and I feel weird about doing anything because it's kind of a lie. I like her, but as a friend. I don't really want to have any kind of digital relationship, be it romantic or sexual, but that seems like what she wants. I don't want to just cut her off, but I don't really know what to do.

 Agreed.

 Agreed as well. Everyone's health concerns deserve to be taken into account and I do not envy the people who have to figure those things out. 
 
 But like you said, clearer rules are needed.

aszbx2-post,"Periodic reminder that the moderators of /r/help engage in politically biased moderation practices and routinely permanently ban users even when they broke no rules whatsoever because they don't approve of their political or religious views 
 
 While /r/help should, in theory, be a nonpartisan and nonpolitical subreddit, it is in fact run by leftist moderators who ban anyone who they consider a ""bigot"" (aka anyone who is even slightly right of them on the political spectrum). For example, if you post a question in /r/help asking how to remove the gay propaganda icon they force down your throat during gay pride month, they will instantly ban you despite the fact that there is nothing bigoted or rule breaking about asking that question and it is in fact a legitimate question 
 
 Evidently, the moderators of /r/help are very strongly against anyone who they consider to be ""unaccepting of LGBT people"" - even if you're not actually unaccepting of them, but openly hate socially conservative/religious people and consider us ""bigots"" for following the tenets of our faith and asking how to remove content we find offensive from our Reddit page layout",Neutral,0

Beyond that, it being true in the US is enough. I presume the ""75% of doctors"" was for the US as well? 
 
 > My mother is a doctor, yet she still managed to have two children. 
 
 Your mother is an incredible woman. She is very rare. The OBGYN that delivered most of my kids was pregnant twice when my wife was. Yet there is a fallacy in pointing to her. Everyone knows that the world would be better with more women like her. Yet making it easier to accomplish what she did doesn't make more women like her, it just lowers the bar. It's like pointing to a remarkable immigrant to justify more immigration. It neglects the way selection works. 
 
 > huge daycare costs and minimal maternal and no paternal leave. I think improving the childcare system in this country would help a lot more women be able to be both a parent and a doctor. Can we at least agree on that? 
 
 No. It would be better for women to stay home and raise their own children. There is no need for half of doctors to be women. That is just a silly, pointless objective. Instead, we should just focus on relaxing the regulations that make cost of living high. The only reason daycare is expensive in some places is that there are absurd levels of regulation. Every time a child gets hurt, the state rushes in to impose laws to ensure it never happens again. That might sound nice, and that's why it happens, but another way of stating that series of events is outlawing low cost child care. Instead, we should let the market offer a variety of products and let parents choose. Daycare has low startup costs and therefore can be very competitive. There are already plenty of incentives to provide safe care without the intervention of regulators who don't pay the costs they impose. The same goes for vehicles, homes, medicine, and many other products/services. People should be allowed to choose the quality of product that they want or offer. 
 
 Trying to impose what you want with government is always an inefficient method. This is especially true for a pointless thing like forcing women into the workforce. We do not need more government, we need less feminism.",IdentityDirectedAbuse,1

 The northern Yuan dynasty did not fall all at once, and for a while they stayed in contention with the Southern Ming. Luo Guanzhong might have been putting the names Liu Bei,Cao Cao and Sun Quan on paper, but it was really exposé on current or recently historical political events. 
 
 The southern Ming saw themselves as fighting an illegitimate foreign Dynasty to reestablish a dynasty ruled by the ethnically Han people's, in the same vein as Liu Bei trying to reestablish the venerable Han Empire in Shu-Han from Wei usurpers. 
 
 So Liu Bei became an allegory for the southern Ming patriots and Cao Cao for the evil northern led Yuan ""usurpers"". Basically RoTK was written to be propaganda so of course Liu Bei was righteous and Cao Cao the cynical villain.",Neutral,0

 I'm not happy, I can't remember the last time I was, and I'm not sure I even know what I need to be happy with my life. I don't know what to do. I've been on antidepressants, and I still feel this way. Sometimes I have good days or good weeks, but I usually end up completely melting down and losing it again over something. I don't know how to make it better or if I even can. 
 
 I can't afford to move out. I can't afford to rent where I live, I certainly can't afford to buy a house or a flat, and I don't see a way out. Every time I'm reminded of the lifestyle my parents had at the same age as me, it upsets me because I know I'll never have that, it's going to pass me by. I don't even know why I want to emulate them in that way because they're divorced now. I'm scared that down the line I'm going to feel like I've missed a whole chapter of my own life. 
 
 My girlfriend broke up with me a year ago. She did the worst thing that anyone has ever done to me, I don't forgive her and I never will. I find it hard to meet people and I thought she was going to be it for me. I still miss her and I think I'm probably going to carry this for the rest of my life. She didn't just take away the relationship, she took away all the hopes and dreams I had for being a proper functioning adult and being happy. What's really bothering me about it right now is that I ruined things - before they even started - with another girl who liked me and who I liked too, to be with her. This absolutely is my fault and even if it probably wouldn't have worked out with her I spend far too much time thinking about if I blew my chance at being happy with someone. 
 
 I hate my job. If you told me tomorrow that it was gone and I could never go back, I wouldn't care. Wouldn't give one single solitary fuck. I hate the building, I hate the place it's in, I hate the noise, I hate the customers, I hate all of it. I could just find a new job and leave, but I feel so completely ground down and I don't think I would find anything better so I can't motivate myself to. I could go back to university and learn to do something else but not without getting myself into a lot of debt I'll never be able to pay off. 
 
 I've never wanted to have a real job, because I can't handle the real world. As a kid I dreamed of being an athlete, although it became clear pretty early on that I was never going to be. I love sports but I'm just not good enough to even play at a recreational level, and that kills me and I don't enjoy them as much as I would like because of that. Then I started to pursue music, and I was OK at that, but I just can't do it. I can't meet other people who share the same musical aspirations as me, I can't write a song because nothing comes out when I try to, I just can't get it right. 
 
 I can't stop obsessing over things that I can't change. I can't stop obsessing over perfection and trying to obtain it. I can't stop obsessing over how all kinds of small details in my life are wrong. I can't feel part of anything. I can't even build a set of fucking shelves. I can't have all the time back that I've wasted. I can't cope.

I'm not even doing that poorly. I have all A's and a B. And the B is in fucking physics for pre med college students, it's hard. 
 
 And they actually asked me *why* I'm suicidal. I just fucking am I can't help it it's been like this for 5 years but it's been a lot worse recently. Then my dad fucking turns to my mom and asks her why she was suicidal in high school and she says ""because my parents didn't love me or care about me and put me in dangerous situations, and I didn't tell anyone I just attempted but failed,"" and then turns back to me and says ""what's your excuse? do you really think we don't love you or something?"" Like I'm sorry I'm losing the My Life is Hard competition but I can't just stop feeling like this. And then he finishes up with ""you won't actually do it. you're too selfish."" Honestly fuck my life at this point. 
 
 I started crying and told them I just want some support right now and my dad said ""you really think we don't give you fucking support"" and went on some tangent about how hard his life is because of me and how much he does to support me like no I'm talking about right now this topic I just want you to tell me it's gonna be okay. 
 
 All of this was after a like glorious 2 month period of my parents being really nice to me then they hit me with all this shit. 
 
 I'm so hurt and starting to think I can't be around them anymore. They're behavior just changes so fucking drastically like this and I don't think I can live with them any longer. I was planning on living at home my freshman year of college (next year) to save money since they offered and we live close to the campus I'm gonna go to but now they're saying they're not sure if they wanna help me anymore and I was told ""have fun trying to cover your dorm expenses with your financial aid because we're not gonna help you pay for it."" Like they're testing if I'll actually leave. I'm fucking confused and trapped. Shit fucking sucks man I'm really hurt.

I told them about the unfair bannings, and they said ""They do it to themselves by Posting Dumb Shit"" 
 
 This prompted a snarky comeback from me, and then they muted me.

bklvh5-post,"I used to be depressed. For about 10 years, after dropping out of college. About 5 months ago after spreading myself incredibly thin trying to solve everyone else's problems in my clan, I meet someone who seems to just click with me. 
 
 No name but a letter. Anime pic. Everything should have told me this is a catfish. 
 
 But I was so fucking lonely. 
 
 It comes to be this person happens to be extremely rich on Runescape, and offered to give me 20 bonds for gold premier. 
 
 The catch? I had to give them the 7 bonds I had already, because ""It'll be a better gift if I give you all 20!"" 
 
 Of course I do so without thinking. 
 
 Trade complete. 
 
 B has left the clan. B has logged off. 
 
 I'm just sitting there staring at those words on my screen. 
 
 This must be a prank, right? No one would do that, be nice to someone then backstab them as soon as they get something, right? 
 
 10 minutes pass. I haven't moved. One of my friends PM's me ""Why are you on that world?"" 
 
 All I could manage to say was ""I don't know."" 
 
 I'd just gotten scammed because I was thinking with my dick. 
 
 I can't show my face to my clan anymore. They'll never let me live it down. I can't handle that. I'm supposed to be the clan mediator who helps everyone resolve issues. Not the completely broken mask that it actually is. 
 
 So I left. Never logged in again. On anything. Totally off the grid save my job. 
 
 A month goes by. My phone blares notifications at me... ""Naive we miss you."" ""Naive, hope you're okay."" ""Naive what happened?"" ""Naive we're really worried."" 
 
 Lies. All lies. 
 
 About a month and a half ago, I finally summon the energy to go to the doctor. I just tell her right out I'm depressed. She prescribes me 200mg Bupropion, twice daily. 
 
 So now I'm on medication for depression. Doesn't feel like anything. 
 
 Until 3 weeks ago. 
 
 All of a sudden, I'm a completely different man. Garulous, entertaining, genuinely fun to talk to. Came back to my clan ecstatic. Things are looking good for once. 
 
 Except when you didn't agree with me. 
 
 Then I was the absolute hugest asshole in existence. Because how DARE someone try to harsh my happiness? 
 
 So I treat them like I would any other asshole. I mocked them. I poked fun at all the words they say. And when they inevitably fight back, I get underhanded. Start slinging shit that was told to me in confidence. 
 
 Of course they respond in kind. And then I played the victim. Dissected their words and arguments, completely contradicting myself at times just to win the argument. 
 
 Oh I won the arguments. But now the entire clan hates me. They don't even acknowledge me when I speak in the clan. 
 
 I've become *that* guy. The one you have to tip toe around on eggshells because he might snap and bite your head off. 
 
 I've become the crazy one. 
 
 I'm not fixed. Sure I'm no longer depressed. 
 
 But I've never felt more isolated than I do in this very moment. 
 
 They just wrote me off. I can't blame them. No one wants to deal with someone whose perception of reality is this fucked. 
 
 No one wants to hear out why I'm saying the things I say. No one is acknowledging that I said I need another break from Discord. No one cares. 
 
 So I left. Again. 
 
 I shouldn't be around people. I'm trash. Filth. The worst kind of asshole, the one that *has* to be right. 
 
 Don't end up like me. If you were depressed and now feel almost insanely good, see your doctor.

It's not like Epic is providing a better service than Steam. In fact, if you look at their capabilities, they are providing a lesser service (with less functions). The game and the content is the same. All of the benefits are for the developer. I mean if we look at the situation with taxis and ride shares, it's clear where the consumer is getting a better deal. So realistically, it's just an unpleasant situation but no unexpected. It's a business first and they go where the money is. 
 
 That being said competition is healthy when it drives businesses towards improvements. But that's not what Epic is doing right now. They aren't even addressing the consumer, which is evident by their store being so unfinished. They are addressing the developers. Once they have amassed enough clout in the business, they might start offering benefits to customers but right now, it's not about the public. It's about the gaming development industry. 
 
 I'll freely admit I never buy a game at launch. It has nothing to do with it being buggy or something like that. I just don't have the money.

 > Inbreeding is more harmful as a practice than the individual instances. 
 
 I think that's fair, but that seems like more of a pragmatic argument to put prohibitions on it than a moral argument against its practice. It seems to me like at the end of the day the issue is still that by having sex two relatives increase the risk of health problems in future generations. This effect is compounded by successive generations of incest in a way that could be *especially* harmful, but idk it seems to me like if you're going to argue that incest on the whole is immoral that need to apply to individual instances and not just multigenerational practices.

 If you like comics The Watchmen has great symbolism and framing. As does V for Vendetta. The Sandman comics are good, too. I also recommend Ichi the Killer if you are feeling adventurous. It is definitely NSFW/L depending on your views. Ichi is one piece of work I try to get other people to read because I still have some serious unanswered questions about things.

That leads to happy red state supporters that show up at the polls for the GOP in the next election.

ejts6sl,"Many stupid people are using the misquoted and invalid 40% statistic, so here goes. TL:DR; The 40% number is wrong and plain old bad science. In attempt to recreate the numbers, by the same researchers, they received a rate of 24% while including violence as shouting. Further researchers found rates of 7%, 7.8%, 10%, and 13% with stricter definitions and better research methodology. 
 
 The 40% claim is intentionally misleading and unequivocally inaccurate. Numerous studies over the years report domestic violence rates in police families as low as 7%, with the highest at 40% defining violence to include shouting or a loss of temper. The referenced study where the 40% claim originates is Neidig, P.H.., Russell, H.E. & Seng, A.F. (1992). Interspousal aggression in law enforcement families: A preliminary investigation. It states: 
 
 Survey results revealed that approximately 40% of the participating officers reported marital conflicts involving physical aggression in the previous year. 
 
 There are a number of flaws with the aforementioned study: 
 
 The study includes as 'violent incidents' a one time push, shove, shout, loss of temper, or an incidents where a spouse acted out in anger. These do not meet the legal standard for domestic violence. This same study reports that the victims reported a 10% rate of physical domestic violence from their partner. The statement doesn't indicate who the aggressor is; the officer or the spouse. The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The ""domestic violence"" acts are not confirmed as actually being violent. The study occurred nearly 30 years ago. This study shows minority and female officers were more likely to commit the DV, and white males were least likely. Additional reference from a Congressional hearing on the study: 
 
 An additional study conducted by the same researcher, which reported rates of 24%, suffer from additional flaws: 
 
 The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The study was not a random sample, and was isolated to high ranking officers at a police conference. This study also occurred nearly 30 years ago. 
 
 More current research, including a larger empirical study with thousands of responses from 2009 notes, 'Over 87 percent of officers reported never having engaged in physical domestic violence in their lifetime.' Blumenstein, Lindsey, Domestic violence within law enforcement families: The link between traditional police subculture and domestic violence among police (2009). Graduate Theses and Dissertations. 
 
 Yet another study ""indicated that 10 percent of respondents (148 candidates) admitted to having ever slapped, punched, or otherwise injured a spouse or romantic partner, with 7.2 percent (110 candidates) stating that this had happened once, and 2.1 percent (33 candidates) indicating that this had happened two or three times. Repeated abuse (four or more occurrences) was reported by only five respondents (0.3 percent)."" A.H. Ryan JR, Department of Defense, Polygraph Institute ""The Prevalence of Domestic Violence in Police Families.""

One thing I'll say is try to work on letting go a little, you know, keep from obsessing over things you can't change. All you can do is learn from what you've been through and figure out what you're going to do about your current situation. No human is ever going to be perfect because that's not what it means to be human, we all fuck up, it's ok. You're not entitled for being bothered by these things. Your ex didn't take away your chances of being happy and functioning regularly. You can't put your happiness and well-being in the hands of others because there's no guarantee that any realationship will last forever. And even if you didn't end up with the last girl you were talking to, there's going to be another one eventually. But in my opinion you should try to focus more on bettering yourself before you jump straight back into a realationship. That's what I'm doing right now. I know you can't afford rent but maybe get a therapist if you can it can be very helpful if you find a good one. Lastly if you really enjoy music you should pursue it for your own sake. Sure nothing is going to come out immediately but but give it time, eventually you'll figure out a way to write out what's on your mind. It takes time and effort to get any art form ""right"" so you should focus on having fun with it while trying to get better. You can't give up just because it doesn't come to you instantly.

bglvqh-post,"We first got the internet in our house in 1998; I was 12. The first website I visited was TheForce.Net; the second was a porn site. I'd already discovered masturbation a year prior but unfettered web access blew the doors off the whole fucking thing. As a shy and introverted kid, who'd been relentlessly teased by girls in middle school and junior high and had learned to fear them, and who was now going to an all boys high school, it was a godsend for my raging, gooey hormones. I didn't have to worry about girls anymore! Everything I knew about naked girls in my teenage years, I learned from the internet. It felt like the perfect — and safe — release valve. It was also a prime enabler of avoidance of girls, and of never needing to confront the reality that not all girls were going to make fun of me. My grades never suffered, and I did have friends, but I was pretty well in the internet porn bubble by 15. 
 
 Around then, my porn tastes had expanded from merely jacking to pictures of naked women and low quality video clips to reading erotica. Lots of it. Literotica was a wonderland for me. I also got to indulge my curiosity in gay porn, and I found the sheer novelty of it to be breathtakingly exciting. I mixed it in with all the opposite-sex porn I was consuming I began a long period of questioning my sexuality, even though being surrounded by guys all day, I never felt attracted or infatuated to a single one of them. It never occurred to me at 16 and 17 that I was responding to the novelty and the taboo of watching gay porn, and that it did not align with my own sexual preferences. Soon after I graduated from high school, I decided to put it to the test — I found a guy my age who lived nearby, and I actually lost my virginity to him. It did not do a damn thing for me, and I came away confident that I wasn't gay, but the porn consumption continued. 
 
 I didn't date at all from 17 to 20. I'd had my first girlfriend during high school and it was very exciting in a physical sense, thereby proving that I was still very much attracted to girls, but that had long since ended and I retreated into my shell of depression/anxiety and enough porn to suffocate a lesser man. High speed internet had come into our home, so now there was more porn, and it was *faster!* Now there were streaming sites; Xtube was an early favorite of mine. It was so comforting and reliable, and it never made me feel anxious; ashamed, but never anxious. 
 
 I starting dating my first real girlfriend when I was 20, and she was the first time I'd ever had sex with a woman, and the first time I'd had sex at all since that one guy I'd experimented with. I enjoyed sex with her but was still pretty anxious and inhibited about not living up to the dudes I'd watched in pornos, both professional and amateur. This led to a lot of performance anxiety, and using masturbation as a self-soothing mechanism, it gave rise to erectile dysfunction as well. Erectile dysfunction at 21 years old. Can you fucking believe it? It was a source of tension in the relationship, amongst other things — namely my untreated anxiety and depression, which I didn't want to accept and face. My porn consumption bothered her as well. Long story short, we lasted two years before the entire relationship deteriorated. This did nothing to improve my self-esteem. 
 
 Over the next decade, I went on a ton of first dates that went nowhere, and had a handful of one-night stands where I could force myself to perform (at least) adequately. Entire days, nights, and weekends would be consumed by porn — streaming videos, pictures, literary erotica, and once I found Reddit, a ton of the gonewild-type subs. I'd be masturbating four or five times a day when I was alone. It would leave me feeling drained and utterly revolted by myself. My socialization dropped like a rock as a result of intense anxiety, and the excessive masturbation was being used as an avoidance mechanism to hold the anxiety at bay. It was all a terribly dysfunctional cycle. 
 
 A few months ago, the woman of my dreams, whom I'd been dating for over a year, left me for reasons unrelated to my masturbation habits. It broke me, and I'm now finally getting therapy for the anxiety that has held my life in a death grip since adolescence. And now, it's time to leave masturbation behind too. I've masturbated five times in the last twenty-four hours due to obvious anxiety issues and I cannot stand it anymore. I'm feeling disgusted and ashamed of myself for the last time. I'm going to get better, and goddammit I'm going to pursue the type of life and relationships I deserve. This cannot be anymore. My life cannot be crippled by anxiety and its toxic coping mechanisms any longer. No more porn. No more gonewild subs. No nothing. The next time I see a naked woman is gonna be when she's standing right in front of me, however long it takes. 
 
 I'm done jerking myself into a coma, just like I'm done hiding from the world. I don't deserve to be treated this way *by my own self*, let alone anybody else. My mission to improve my life has gained a new facet and an extra shot in the arm. Telling my story on a public forum such as this is my way of owing it and drawing the dividing line between the past and the future. Thanks for reading.

bip8n8-post,"The blog posts speak for themselves better than anything I could ever write, so here are a bunch of excerpts without commentary: 
 
 [*""The brain size of the World's most successful woman""*]( 
 >I have heard Oprah state on her show that she has to have her hats custom made because her head measures 25.25 inches around, a cranium so large that two wigs had to be sewn together to fit her for her Oscar nominated performance in *The Color Purple*. This equates to 641.4 mm. [...] Assuming this sample is roughly representative of adult female U.S. crania, Oprah's head perimeter is 6.3 SD above the mean of American women. 
 
 [*""Independent confirmation of Oprah's head size""*]( 
 >The late Gene Siskel went hat shopping with Oprah and the salesman said Oprah's was the largest head he'd ever seen. Using the late J.P. Rushton's idea of using the formula for calculating the volume of a hemisphere (V = circumfence\^3 / 118.4) Oprah would have a cranial capacity of 2229 cm\^3... 
 
 [*""Brain size & ethnic genetic interests at 70th annual Tony Awards""*]( 
 >I spent Sunday evening trying to watch anything other than the news and I stumbled upon the 70th annual Tony Awards. Generally speaking, high IQ people tend to be fans of the arts, so it came as no surprise to see arguably the biggest brained and most successful woman on the planet, multi-billionaire Oprah, dominating the event. 
 
 [*""IQ & fighting back against racism""*]( 
 >Oprah's 2029 cc cranial capacity gave her the IQ to handle racists with style. When a skinhead called her a monkey and then tried to change the subject, Oprah grabbed him by the arm and said '""I want to talk about the *monkey business*"". This showed lateral thinking because they were literally talking about monkeys... 
 
 [*""Big brained Oprah triples the value of Weight Watchers stock; could make $100 million in 36 hours""*]( 
 >With a cranial capacity of perhaps 2,029 cm\^3, Oprah has just adapted her situation to her advantage, by buying a 10% share in Weight Watchers, and watching the stock roughly triple in a few days, making her potentially $100 million richer in only 36 hours. 
 
 [*""Big Brained Oprah tried to stop the war with Iraq""*]( 
 >While no human in history has had a deviation IQ much beyond 200, Oprah's 2,029 cc estimated brain size is arguably around what you would statistically expect from a 400 IQ being, and so was the wisdom she displayed in the run-up to the war in Iraq. [...] It seems marvelously symbolic that Oprah, arguably the biggest brained member of America's elite ultimately passed that test with such flying colours, and got on the right side of history. 
 
 [*""Getting rich off cold winter genes""*]( 
 >...one day Oprah's enormous brain size seemed to allow her the higher level cognitive ability that transcended cognitive abilities themselves: Meta cognition; self-awareness [...] How did Oprah display self-awareness? Martha Stewart began showing Oprah a very efficient way to maneuver a bed sheet, and asked Oprah to grap one corner of the bed sheet. Sensing she didn't have the spatial ability to perform the task competently and not wanting to look foolish in front of millions of TV viewers, Oprah was forced to adapt. Instead of grabbing the corner of the sheet, Oprah spontaneously ran to the audience to grab a Martha Stewart fan. 
 
 [*""Only Ashkenazi Jews were smart enough to compete with Oprah""*]( 
 >As a compassionate social Darwinist, I watched in great fascination as arguably the biggest brained member of both her race and her gender, emerged as the World's richest black and the World's most influential woman. [...] It seemed to me her huge brain size was giving her an ability to come up with witty comments, and down-home folksy wisdom that kept the audience entertained. [...] With a cranial capacity almost as stratospheric as Oprah's, Rosie [O'Donnell] had the smarts to become the only gentile in syndicated talk show history to almost beat Oprah in the ratings 
 
 [*""Has any self-made woman or black in history EVER been the most powerful person on Earth?""*]( 
 >The only self-made woman and the only black who has come close to being the most powerful person on Earth has been Oprah, who for years reigned as the billionaire Queen of all Media and kingmaker to Obama's presidency, but she was born with a freakishly large brain size which helped make her especially smart. [...] Had her IQ been even higher still (150 instead of 140), she might have made the leap from Presidential king maker to President. 
 
 [*""How Oprah cured my homophobia""*]( 
 >...to hear the World's most influential woman give [a political opinion] that was so succinct, loud, powerful and graphic, and on behalf of an oppressed minority other than her own, just brought the house down. In that moment, my homophobia was cured. [...] Rather than trying to defend an awkward argument, Oprah had the cognitive adaptability to shift gears completely, by saying ""I wasn't trying to absurd, sir"" [...] Big brained Oprah then cleverly used her power which he did not have, by cutting to commercial break. 
 
 [*""Big brained black billionaire""*]( 
 >A thousand years from now, when no one even knows who Oprah was, anthropologists might dig through the soil and discover a skeleton with a colossal cranial capacity and assume it belonged to someone extremely intelligent.  They'll think it must have belong to some rare super human, perhaps a more evolved species.  They might then discover the remains of her massive brick mansion and realize her intelligence allowed her to rule over the other humans of her time. 
 
 [*""Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful...beautiful brain""*]( 
 >But the ultimate brain scan art would be if Oprah posed intimately with other luminaries, since Oprah's arguably both the biggest brained member of both her race and her gender and the most successful member of both her race and her gender. The MRI scan could be displayed in the Oprah Winfrey wing of the **Smithsonian's** new National Museum of African American History and Culture.",Neutral,0

bgopk0-post,"For background, I (25M) have been with my current girlfriend (21F) for nearly 2 years, and we have been going pretty well in terms of everything major. We rarely argue, we share very similar mindsets and interests, but the smaller differences are starting to affect me. 
 
 
 I can say that she could be my future wife if she dropped a few habits, but I honestly don't see her doing so. She smokes cigarettes and does a lot of recreational drugs; cannabis, mdma, psychedelics, and has recently been interested in dmt. She has mild depression, diagnosed anxiety, and doesn't have any hobbies. Because she doesn't have any hobbies, she is always smoking marijuana daily, and she is always looking for the next opportunity to do mdma(once every few months) and I feel like her life is revolving around recreational drugs, albeit this is not heavy usage, purely to pass time. She is obsessed with having children and more pets, but at times her depression leads to neglect her current pets. She is insistent on having children in the future, but I can easily see the drug habits and depression affecting the well-being of her child and any future pets she wants to adopt. She does not see her drug problem as an issue, and says that she has the will to quit of necessary, but I don't believe her because I have seen how low her depression can pull her down. 
 
 
 As for some background on myself, I'm a quiet introvert with a lot of hobbies, stable job with a mortgage, I occupy my time with various things, like home improvement, computer games and watching netflix. I also have a lot of creative art hobbies that I do from time to time. My view on recreational drugs is quite lax, I am aware that they do have inherent health risks and toxicity but this isn't the sub to discuss that. What I am willing to say is that I also enjoy recreational drugs from time to time, but I'd prefer it to be less frequent, and for it to not be the main focus of an activity. 
 
 
 Since being with my girlfriend, my drug usage has increased, and often times we will resort to smoking weed just to pass time. There is also a heavy expectation on me to sort out activities and entertainment for any given weekday, and she will complain loudly if not occupied. This will often default back to smoking more cannabis, which I'm not the greatest fan of. 
 
 
 I have suggested many times for her to adopt a hobby, but she dismisses this and continues to occupy her time with drugs, when I try to push the matter, she will need to smoke cigarettes to alleviate her stress. 
 
 
 I honestly love my girlfriend, and I can see us staying together indefinitely if we stay on a similar path, but her insistence of a child conflicts with her cigarette and drug use. I would have no issues with her lifestyle if she didn't want a child; but as she is so clucky and unwilling to care for herself, I feel that any child brought into this world will be in danger. 
 
 
 I really don't know how to approach the matter, and I have been thinking about this for the longest time. I can't see her using less drugs, changing her mind about having a child, or picking up hobbies to occupy her time, and this is a major hurdle in our relationship. I can see us being best friends, and her having a child with another person, but I would still worry about the welfare of the kid, and breaking up and remaining mutual friends is always an idealistic situation that rarely works out.

Yesterday outside the vet office was my worst one, where a dog ran up to me off leash barking and not quite growling so I got into an aggressive stance and yelled ""Hey"" a couple times at it while it stood in front of me barking and moving around trying to decide if it wanted to run towards or away from me.

b3vvhp-post,"Either accept the reality or change it. 
 
 **I propose that once upon a time Reddits subreddits were about discussing a subject.** 
 
 So /r/Food would be about discussing food. /r/News about discussing News. 
 The same way even the political and other more divisive subreddits were about the subject itself. 
 
 Even if /r/Socialism was run by a socialist and /r/Capitalism by a capitalist the purpose was not to create a community of socialists or capitalists but discuss the subjects, events and happenings concerning them. 
 
 Today almost no sub is about about discussing it **but being part of it, being supportive of it, being loyal to it.** 
 (Exceptions for like ""True, or Truetrue subs). 
 
 This is why TD bans even supporters of **Donald Trump** when critically analyzing the presidents actions in say his ever more hawkish appointments. 
 
 Or why various socialist subs ban outright **socialist members** for lifting the issue in Venezuela from a critical point of view. 
 
 Or even why the mods in /r/Food will ban you for criticizing someones food, or notion of food or beauty or taste of food. 
 
 The concept of what a sub is about has changed. Or rather what a sub is *for*. Subreddits are no longer divisions of topics but divided communities. 
 
 I remember on one of my older accounts one of my first banishments was in a subreddit for something literally called ""/r/soylent"" (from the movie Soylent Green) and rebranded as something positive. I was absolutely downvoted and then banished after a prolonged discussion (with little give and take) and I've seen this mannerism now spread to all sectors of Reddit. 
 
 We either need to change this very fundamental of perception in ourselves or we must accept that even completely benign and neutral subreddits like say /r/News or your local subreddit will be taken over by a particular group and that group will congregate around their definition of the subject and then proceed to isolate voices that do not adhere to that as it progresses to define itself, whether openly or subconsciously. 
 
 
 We must rethink what we use reddit for or concede that this is the future. 
 
 
 
 
 ____ 
 
 
 A way to stop this would be to change a fundamental concept of Reddit. To forbid subreddits from having selective enforcing based on any stance on any one issue. 
 
 So you could talk as much shit about socialism as you wanted in a socialist sub as you could talk shit about capitalism in a capitalist sub as long as you followed the rest of the subs rules. 
 
 I honestly think that it's either this or we might as well shut up about it, because organic change might not come about as all the subs are now protecting themselves against brigading and ""concern trolling"" and other such things the same way an arms race in real life functions. So either make them all bend the knee or the struggle is pointless. But at least we can come to a common understanding of why it is happening, hence this thread. This way we can also stop acting out as victims of a particular ideology, religion, sex, location, interest or what ever when we get banned.

 This is a dicey topic. Over there someone pointed out that she should have gone to a more pet friendly place, but people are forgetting that prior to ESA laws opening up, it was *impossible* to find pet friendly places. *Especially* for large animals. I lived in an apartment complex in the 00's with a dog run that allowed large dogs, and worked there for a bit. We were the *only* complex that allowed dogs in the area, through the major city we abutted. And by the time I left, they had come up with the brilliant idea of instituting ""pet rent,"" an increase of rent to cover pet fees on *top* of usurious non-refundable security fees. 
 
 ESA certification allowed people to have a pet, a desperately needed pet who yes, have been proven to have deep psychological benefits to their people, without having to go through all of the difficulties. Especially poor people, who are usually unable to find other methods of coping and need them the most. 
 
 On the other side, not everyone can handle ESA's. I love dogs, I've had some amazing dogs. But I was attacked as a child by a few dogs and it took a while for me to manage my fear and distrust. I still have a deep and unreasonable hatred of cocker spaniels, can't help it. My husband is allergic. I am too, mildly though. If the dog has been bathed in a week, I'm usually fine. 
 
 We were in a pizza restaurant eating and a couple came in with an [afghan dog]( They allowed some children to play with and pet the dog, which was shedding noticeably as it was summer. My husband started to have an allergic reaction. The couple sat, he asked the pizza people to please have the dog put outside. As he was doing this, some customers came in behind where my kid and I were sitting, saw the dog, made disgusted comments, and left. 
 
 Husband stormed back and left; they chose to keep the dog in the restaurant despite his visible allergic reaction. My husband, the man I call Snow White incarnate, who held a battered dog on the side of the road we found until the police arrived to take her to the vet, just wanted to eat in peace and this was denied him. So, we left. The emotional presence of a dog for that couple was more important than the physical health of my husband. 
 
 I've utilized the ESA privileges (for housing), as I do have qualifying conditions. I've never taken my animals anywhere they wouldn't legally be allowed without it, however. I still remember vividly what it felt like to have that dog turn and look at me and lunge. I still see it every time I see a cocker spaniel. I see my husband with certain dog breeds, even though he adored them, red eyed, runny nosed, choking. I also remember how lucky I felt to find a place that allowed big dogs so I could get my girl, and the amazing life I had with her. 
 
 It seems to me we need to have much clearer rules. We need to be able to have purely animal free places for people who legitimately need it *and* places that allow it. The issue is that when you give a landlord the option, they will generally choose no animals since that is the cheapest option. (Seriously, one couple force bred their Pitts to sell the litter - inbred idiots - and kept the pups indoors so we wouldn't know and then absconded in the night. We had to go down to the sub floor it was so bad). If you force it to be open to all, then you have no place for the people who *can't* be around animals and are unable to afford to pay for a house. Why are they worth less than people who need ESA's?

Higher risks require greater research and resources to reduce than lower risks, so I think it makes sense that high-risk populations are given special attention. ~~Except when they're not, because the NHS denies many transgender people any sort of support outside of GICs, and since GIC waiting lists are often 2+ years long that means the NHS it means people experiencing problems such as suicidal ideation as a result of dysphoria receive no help for 2 years.~~ That said, we definitely need to do a lot more to reduce suicide rates of everyone, because not enough is being done for anyone.",Neutral,0

b5ee51-post,"Does this count as [off my meta] if I'm complaining about stuff on this sub? 
 
 Based on my own personal experience and other posts I've seen, I would argue there is a real problem with people attacking the OP for venting views they do not like. I get this isn't a safe space for any specific groups and I'm not saying people can't disagree with what someone is venting about. I've gotten into it quite a bit with some people's venting here, like them hating an entire group of people because of the actions of a few. However, far too often do I notice people resort to personal attacks, aka ad hominem fallacy. Not to mention this violates rule 4 of this sub. I suspect the reason this rule is in place is to stop this sort of thing. Attack the argument, not the person. 
 
 Basically, instead of people addressing why they disagree with what someone is venting about, they often try to discredit the person by making claims like ""you're not really X"" or ""you're fake and a troll"". That's not to say trolling doesn't happen here, but often, disagreeing with someone's venting is treated as if that person is just trying to get a rise out of people. It's like people refuse to believe someone could have unpopular opinions and stand by them, no, they *must* be trolling. It's very closed minded too, because the person making the troll claim refuses to think outside of their world view. For example, if you're a racial minority, some people have a hard time believing you if you don't fall into stereotypical views for your race. Is it so hard to believe someone can have opinions you don't like and that they believe in them? If they really are trolling, you replying to them just fuels their fire. It's so unproductive to vent if all people are going to do is accuse you of being this or not being that, effectively going against the purpose of this sub. 
 
 Given that the purpose of this sub is to allow opinions and venting that OffMyChest wouldn't allow, I would expect better of people here. I dare say if you want a sub like this where people get auto banned from posting in specific subs that OffMyChest mods don't like, that sub is much more of a fit for you than hanging around here trying to dogpile people who go against your world views. 
 
 So, disagree with me on this if you must, but I think it would be better to debunk my arguments rather than claim I'm a fake and thus, that alone is somehow supposed to invalidate everything I've written.",Neutral,0

bkicmu-post,"This is mostly just for my peace of mind but here goes. 
 
 A few years ago I met a girl, we'll call her Margo, who was amazing in a million ways. She was musical, beautiful, kind, funny, intelligent, and she was not my wife. 
 
 While my marriage was on the rocks at the time, and my wife wasn't around very much, we were still married. It was a very dark time for me, but Margo was like a massive light that enveloped me and reminded me of who I was. 
 
 I think it's worth mentioning that Margo and I never slept together, however we absolutely developed real, and deep feelings for each other. 
 
 Anyway, eventually my wife finds out I've been connecting with Margo, and is (rightfully) furious. There were a few tear filled nights, and some very hard conversations, but in the end, we decided to work things out. I unceremoniously, (and with much difficulty and hesitation) ended contact with Margo. I still feel horrible about how this all happened because she really was an amazing person who didn't deserve any of the drama I brought upon her. 
 
 So, my wife and I work things out, and things are better than they've ever been between us. We re-found the love we had somehow lost, and are stronger because of everything that happened. That being said, there was still always a part of me that was just.... empty and regretful. Not because of how things turned out but because of the way they happened. I was also worried about Margo, because for a long time I was her sounding board, and now, I couldn't help her. 
 
 Tonight I randomly decided to google Margo, and there was a video of her singing a brand new song, and parts of it were too specific to not be about what happened between us, but it gave me closure that everything is alright now. 
 
 It's late and I'm tired but happy. Even though this is a throwaway account I'm hoping this post just gets buried in the ""New"" pile. This was more for me than anything, because I don't really have anyone to talk to about this stuff, and posting it here feels like talking about it.

 To be honest the worst issues I've had come from the more... vocal, steadfast members of the community in general - That's where you'll find 'militant' gays as I like to term them - ones who think bisexuals and transgender people are cheating and aren't included. Which is folly; the one thing we all have in common is discrimination based on a circumstance of birth, it's so sad to see some people in the community act like 'people have to accept me but you cannot be any lower than this or you're scum'.

 > I've been self employed a couple times so maybe I'm biased, but my reason for it was it was the only real way of owning the means of production that can really be accomplished under the current system, but by god it was hard. 
 
 One reply: 
 
 > In a communist system, there should be alternative ways for you to take such an initiative. There should be institutions setup to make sure you have the resources and labor power necessary to accomplish your productive/distributive goals. This would massively increase innovation and creativity within society and allow for the complete transition to full communism. Until we setup these kinds of institutions, full communism remains theoretical. 
 
 So hiring workers in a normal capitalist system isn't adequate enough; therefore government has to step in, and possibly force workers in there if necessary. 
 
 But having an ""adequate"" number of workers means that the owner no longer owns the means of production ... 
 
 That proposal is not only insanely inefficient and counterproductive, but it also provides an excuse for the government to steal the owner's stuff and enslave him or her some more.

Some time ago an artist got blacklash because she made Tiana and the SJWs didn't like the skin tone and the anime nose. There are many anime styles, but the cute big eyed+ small nose is popular and easy to do. It would be weird if in a simplified style you would make a broader extra detailed nose. The background setting and light matters too. Lighting and shading can affect skintone too. It's one thing if it's realism, but with anime styles you don't have to have realistic proportions ( nobody has huge anime eyes IRL lol). The colors look different on different types of screens and I know this because some of my old work looks very vibrant on my new laptop and kinda washed out on a phone screen. It would be cool if people stopped bitching and let artists enjoy creating art. Most fanart I do is usually unpaid work in my free time. With commissions I tell people to show me the exact color for skin, eyes and hair. I never had any complaints about how I draw poc. However, I don't like how artists are being treated. If you don't draw poc you are racist, if you do you are still racist because they are not dark enough. It's funny how it's perfectly ok to draw white chatacters as black, but if you make a black character a shade too light in a pastel style all hell breaks loose.",Neutral,0

ehs6yjs,"Slut has always been an insult for women, not men, and virgin has always been an insult for men, not women. This whole dichotomy exists because of the different ways in which men and women pursue sex. 
 
 It is not difficult to attract sexual partners as a woman. The same is not true of men. Attracting partners is actually challenging as a man, so the ability to do so is seen as that - an ability, a talent, a skill. Now, a woman who has high standards will find difficulty attracting a man who fits them, but it is fundamentally not hard for a woman to find sex if that's all she wants, so choosing whether to be a slut or not is always a conscious choice. If she wants sex, she can get it. If she doesn't, she doesn't. Right-wing society says the choice to be a virgin is the superior one, left-wing society disagrees, but it's still a choice. 
 
 For men, attracting partners is not a choice, it's a challenge. Thus, calling a man a virgin is not at all like calling a woman a slut. Instead, it's akin to saying ""you've never successfully performed this challenge"", like saying you're unathletic because you can't throw a three-pointer, or unintelligent because you can't pass an exam, to the point that even the few straight men who consciously choose not to pursue the challenge of wooing women tend to be put in the same basket as those who try and fail. This is why the word 'virgin' is an insult to men.",IdentityDirectedAbuse,1

Your dad is a sorry excuse for a man saying that to his suicidal child. Disgusting. I can set a standard that makes him an irrelevant worm in comparison too. But that isn't fair, is it? 
 
 
 If I were you: ""Oh alright. Well then, with that, our ""relationship"" has actually just ended. I will no longer speak to you again nor ask you for help. Since you seem nonchalant about my existence in this world, goodbye. Don't speak unless it is in an apologetic manner for the absolute filth you just hurled at me. As for the financial matter, thank you for stating the terms of business. I'll work out a way to sustain myself, since you both have made yourselves abundantly clear. I do not and will not expect monetary aid from you. Thank you."" 
 
 
 I'm in a similar place as you. Both of my parents are acting insane, though one of them actually is a sociopath. And yes I've had suicidal thoughts on and off almost my whole life. My sociopath parent has plenty of money, houses, etc. We've never had a relationship except when I was a baby(doesn't count). I've literally told this parent to not put me in their will. It was to send a message. What's that message? 
 
 
 Money isn't love, and I don't need that from you. I never needed it. I needed a parent, but now it's too late and I'm indifferent(or more accurately don't WANT a relationship). Just like you've been my entire life. If you don't have an innate desire out of your own heart to help your own child, then I absolutely do NOT want anything at all from you. I don't accept blood money. Period. 
 
 
 Leave your parents house ASAP. I'm telling you. I waited too long, don't be like me. Do it NOW. You won't heal/grow properly unless you do. They're probably the ones making you suicidal. Leave and rely on yourself if you have to. That's what I'm doing right now and it feels awesome. If you have to wait and save up money for college I say it's worth it. The satisfaction of not taking a dime from your parent that doesn't care if you exist is priceless. Be independent ASAP. You have innate worth and dignity just by virtue of being a human being. You need to respect yourself too, and know that you have worth. Just because they are your parents, that does not give them impunity to hurl crap at you without consequences. Stand up for yourself, respectfully. Be confident you're in the right and don't let anger consume you. You have value, and are valued, and nobody can take that away. Work however much it takes to get out. Once you're independent and floating your own boat, reexamine your suicidal thoughts if they're there still. I know it sounds kinda dumb but literally tell your suicide to take a back seat and do this task first. I can guarantee you will AT LEAST feel better, and maybe not suicidal anymore. Process of elimination, eliminate the two glaring suspects. Don't keep debating within yourself like ""Oh maybe I can stay longer and they will treat me better"" etc. In your heart of hearts you know whether or not your living environment is toxic to your mental health. Sorry for ranting.

etbk6pc,"CHESTERFIELD COUNTY, Va. (WRIC) — A Chesterfield family spoke with 8News Friday after fending off a naked intruder who broke into their home on South Twilight Lane the night before. The intruder claimed to be the devil and attacked the family, prompting the homeowner to fire 39 rounds. 
 
 The incident was a traumatic experience for the Lewis family's first night in their brand new home. 
 
 
 ""She was in to kill us,"" Melissa Lewis said. ""That was her almighty, to kill us. She attacked us and I held her down just kept on punching her and punching her as hard as I possibly could."" 
 
 The Lewis' dream home now looks like a war zone, with blood soaked into the carpet, the walls and windows riddled with bullets and shell casings scattered all over. 
 
 ""I said 'who are you?"" Lewis' husband, who did not wish to go on camera, explained. ""She said 'I need your help, please help me.' I said 'get out of my house,' and she goes 'I'm the devil.'"" 
 
 
 The homeowner says the woman, who had a blue ponytail, broke into the basement around 10:30 p.m. on July 4. The family said she was laughing menacingly and refused to leave. 
 
 ""She looked possessed, her eyes were completely black, like saucers, and she was laughing like it was a joke,"" Lewis's husband told 8News. 
 
 Fearing for his life, the father of three grabbed his pistol and gave a verbal warning to the woman. With his family sleeping upstairs, he opened fire hoping to scare her off. None of the shots struck the suspect. 
 
 Lewis said the woman aggressively charged at him with superhuman strength. 
 
 ""She was not stopping,"" he said. ""She had the strength of four grown men."" 
 
 When he ran out of bullets, Lewis began throwing furniture at her. His wife and children eventually jumped in and attempted to stop the woman. The intruder didn't stop until one of the children, the Lewis' 12-year-old son Logan, shoved a wrench into her neck. 
 
 
 Police arrested the intruder and she is being treated and evaluated at the hospital. The Lewis family left with bruises and bite marks. 
 
 ""I'm scared to go in there, I won't even go into any room by myself, I'm terrified,"" M. Lewis said. 
 
 Detectives told the family that the suspect lives nearby and will eventually be charged robbery, breaking and entering and attempted murder. She is currently in the ICU with severe head trauma.",Neutral,0

eixs1th,"Steemit is promising but also a ghost town now. Functionality wise it's pretty cool though, like Reddit but more like a blog site, so you can have pictures and video in your post (think instead of image and self post it's the two combined kind of like a html document). 
 
 It's run on a cryptocurrency where the upvotes and karma actually add up to a payout. Naturally it is now 99% bot abuse and karma farming and the shittest shitposts you've ever seen, 1% actual users posting legitimately cool art stuff and of course circlejerking over this week's popular shitcoin. 
 
 The big draw of it, that is both also a huge disadvantage, is that no one can physically delete anything. It can be downvoted (""flagged"") into oblivion and the frontend can be set up to expunge stuff below a score though, and there is no one there to intervene when someone does that. So that makes for a kind of shit culture where people are scared to upset the power users who can drop a -10 dollar flag on your post, or make a bot that auto flags everything. The idea of it is though that it's a monetisation model where the act of voting does a blockchain thing that makes more of that coin, and you get money from it (and the voter gets some as well called curation). In theory yeah that's great, in practice you need literally millions of upvotes from small steem power accounts to amount to anything, and there is nothing stopping some bully from running an account that does nothing but auto flag all submissions by someone. 
 
 But as far as hosting something up there goes it works super well at least lol. And if it were actually populated with a broad userbase it would counteract the problems I mentioned above. To some extent, because you can never really stop someone with power from abusing it.",Neutral,0

 Everyone perceives the world and life subjectively, that's just how it is, that's how we have to get through life. It can be a good thing and a bad thing, and for people who are sensitive, for one, things might feel bad quicker than for others. But that doesn't mean that the pain they're suffering is less ""bad"" for them - as you said. Because that's how they perceive and feel it, so that's absolute reality for them, even if objectively the issue isn't as bad. They still have to live through it. They have to go through the exact pain someone less sensitive would have to go through because of an objectively worse issue. (Most?) People experience life subjectively. The limit to feeling a certain amount of pain for someone sensitive might be lower than for someone less sensitive. But it doesn't mean it's less real, it doesn't mean they're in need of less support and understanding and empathy. It's the same, felt, pain. Often, a sensitive person will feel happiness quicker and easier too. Does that mean they are, really, less happy than a less sensitive person?

 We ship food, we ship mosquito nets and medicine to these poor places. But how do the locals compete with a product that is free? If I want to manufacture mosquito nets and sell them, who will buy my product when they are being given out for free? If I'm a farmer, how do I sell my crop, when the market is being flooded with free food? We are putting locals out of business. We are creating welfare dependents and then, most insidiously, we change the amount being given year by year. We destroy industries and then cut aid a few years later leaving people to starve and die of malaria. 
 
 If we wanted to actually help, we would build industries in those places and create jobs so that they can support themselves instead of being reliant on aid. If anyone who reads this wants to help poorer countries, groups together microloans for 3rd world countries.

entl4bh,"I am experiencing the exact same thing right now. I've taken myself down to 2 days a week because my job, while pretty stress free and easy, is giving me horrible anxiety. I live in a severely overcrowded college town, people are generally awful, parking is non existent, and it costs me $10 a day in parking to even go to work. Driving takes all of my mental energy. It's getting to the point where leaving my house and driving takes 2 days of recovery, afterward. I'm not a people person, have a GED, have physical limitations, hate talking on the phone, and driving a long commute is impossible in my current headspace. It's really limiting what I can do career-wise. My mother passed away last year and left some money behind, so my plan is to buy a house where I can start a greenhouse. Its already become incredibly clear to me that I cant go back to ""salmoning"" in a city I hate, at a job I'm just completely over. I have to make my own way from now on. It has inspired me to start being creative and motivated again. I'm just biding my time and trying to figure out as much as I can while I get myself ready for the next chapter. I guess my only advice is to find something you are passionate about that can be lucrative for you. For me, its growing rare plants. Try doing some freelance or flex jobs if you have useful skills. Take some classes for degrees that allow you to work from home or freelance. That's something I have been considering as a back up plan.",Neutral,0

bxk939-post,"This Reddit post has put into words what I have been thinking lately at night. 
 
 [ 
 
 
 
 I have a sister who passed away a few years ago in her mid 50's...never married, never having children. She was physically disabled with a birth defect, although she had a college degree and was mostly independent. But she never dated, never had relationships. She was extremely lonely and isolated. She was in so much physical pain as well, and was completely addicted to pain medication. (oxycontin, etc) This is after a lifetime of surgeries (over 75-80 of them) and hospital stays. Unlike most with severe mental disabilities, my sister KNEW how screwed up her life was. She HATED it. She contemplated suicide several times. She had to be on antidepressants, go through therapy. I can't even imagine what would have happened to her if she had been born to a family who couldn't have afforded the best for her. 
 
 
 
 The point of all of this is this. As a sister of a loved one who had to call life and death....literally...3 times for my sister's life and watch her go through hell and back, there is no way in hell I would ever NOT abort a fetus if I found out my baby had the same disability. And yes, we had to screen carefully when I was pregnant as I have 2 siblings with this disability. (the other sibling died as an infant) I live in a state passing a heartbeat law, and it pisses me off to no end that these religious political zealots put no value on the quality of life. I would never want any loved one of mine going through what my sister went through. 
 
 
 
 I have family members who post shit on Facebook every day, praising these new laws. I want to smack them, or call them out. These are the same damn family members who didn't visit my sister ever when she needed them most.

Even if it's just looking at a mirror and thinking ""yea I'm good looking"" or anything that's up bringing DO THAT, it may feel super weird and so promise it's gonna b me weird for a while cuz it still is for me and all that but it does change. I'm a completely different person from what I was around 4 months ago. I have confidence now and it's amazing. I can walk up to people and actually talk. Every change starts with yourself.

ei9flxr,"There's multiple layers to it but in the context of the culture war, people are still sour over Ghostbusters and more so The Last Jedi and how Disney seems to be handling their franchises. They see Captain Marvel (CM) as being shoehorned into the MCU, and recent leaks, if they are to be believed, suggest that the Russo Brothers have clashed with Disney over CM's role in End Game. The Marvel comics are also recovering from some ""forced diveristy"" issues that has [completely tanked their sales]( (e.g., female Thor). In short, people are tired of mega corporations pandering to diversity progressiveness at the detriment of quality products. 
 
 More specifically, Brie Larson has made several comments about white movie critics and how she is going out of her way to give people of colour press access. In the grand scheme of things, maybe this isn't so bad, but her comments have caused a ruckus mostly because she comes off as [snooty and posh]( Even feminists have accused her of being a limousine liberal and acting like a white saviour which [she has been accused of before]( Gotta pay those bills though, I guess. 
 
 The trailers drop for CM and people are unimpressed. This causes media outlets to pump out their preemptive ""incels are back to ruin CM"" narrative. This attracts negative attention and people go to Rotten Tomatoes to say they aren't interested in the movie. This intensified the tension and more articles were written which attracted trolls and genuine pissed off comic and movie patrons alike. The shit snowball keeps rolling and keeps getting bigger. 
 
 The movie comes out and reviews are mixed, even from people one might consider ""woke"". Rotten Tomatoes deletes reviews which intensifies tensions further. People fed up with the ""SJWing"" of preexisting intellectual properties smell blood in the water and keep clashing with people whining about Trump's America being plagued by white nationalist, sexist, GamerGater incels.

attuga-post,"My friend (let's call her C) was basically one of my first friends in college, and she's helped me through a lot of tough shit (depression, anxiety, losing a family member, losing a friend). I've known her since sophomore year, and now we're both seniors. I'm graduating in 2.5 months, but she's staying for a 5th year. Most of my friends are juniors or staying for a 5th year, so it's going to be really tough for me to leave my friends behind. My college friends are like my family. 
 
 I've also helped C through a nasty breakup with one of her previous girlfriends. Because of this, I was happy for her when she got her new girlfriend last year, but now I think things have gotten weird. 
 
 She literally spends all her time with her girlfriend. Like always. Even though C lives with just one other dude, her girlfriend is practically her third roommate, and I know this pisses off C's actual roommate. C's girlfriend doesn't go to college and just lives in the same town we go to school in. 
 
 C has just gradually stopped talking to me. She even killed our ~600 day snapchat streak a few months ago for practically no reason. Sometimes she'll randomly send me a meme or two on Facebook and I'll try to start a conversation with her, but 95% of the time the conversation ends with her leaving me on read. 
 
 Sometimes, I'll see C's other friends around on campus and they'll ask me if I've ever heard from C, because they haven't. Because of this I know this isn't something C's just doing to me, but she's doing this to all her friends. 
 
 I'm happy that C is happy in her relationship, but I'm hurt that she's practically cut off myself and all of her other friends. Since I'm graduating in a few months, I want to spend as much time with all of my friends as possible before I leave campus. I haven't seen her in months, and I'm worried that if she doesn't get her shit together, I may not see her again before I graduate

 I have received more or less the same answers you received, although in my case it was always forceful molestation. There is still this underlying thought from men that mostly see the other sex as a chance to be sexual with rather than human beings first, but not when without them, mostly with strangers or friends or acquaintances. I think in a few years things will change, and hopefully the awareness of rape being a general problem, depression and sadness being top priorities to fight along obesity as cause of death, will progress once and for all.",Neutral,0

 However, there do seem to be people taking an honest approach to things, like [this guy]( 
 
 I don't know, and I'm also not Canadian and don't know much about the details to be honest.

 I think by making this post it shows you do want to change, and by having regret over not doing things at the end of the year it shows you want to change as well. That is important, if you don't really have the drive to grow, then you aren't going to. 
 
 I don't know where you live, but perhaps there is a community center, or a park? A place for you to walk? Going to a center or a park where there are people could help you make friends, and get exercise as well. If you don't know how to break the ice with someone, giving them a compliment might work, or asking them a question about something they have with them (like, ""oh that's a cool phone, what kind is it?""). Take the conversation from there (if they seem comfortable with the confrontation). You can't make friends if you don't put yourself out there at least a little. 
 
 I also don't know your interests, but go to places where you can find people with similar ones. If you go to a store that has things that interest you, even talking to the employees could help. They probably have an interest in the thing too, and they have to be welcoming to customers, so it is good practice to try talking to them if you are still uncomfortable with the idea of making friends. Also, chatting with people online leads to more practice as well as online friends that can be there for you! 
 
 For losing weight, start simple. Don't tell yourself you are going to start going to the gym everyday if you don't think you will, and don't feel bad for knowing how much you can or can't handle. Again, I don't know how chubby you are, but you know yourself. Take a walk everyday, introduce one healthy food into your life (or take away one unhealthy food) every week if diet is a problem for you. And let yourself have a cheat day, it can help you in the long run. If you are scared to work out in public, buy some weights of your own and watch some Netflix while lifting them. Make it somewhat enjoyable so you stick with it, so ooh don't get discouraged for not wanting to follow through. I believe in you!

eidv19w,"Why you do need dysphoria to be trans 
 
 1. Dysphoria can be defined in a non medical way. Such as ""the condition of feeling one's emotional and psychological identity as male or female to be opposite to one's biological sex."" it's weird that such an intersectional definition comes (besides the fact that it ignores nonbinaries) is from the racist and sexist Google dictionary that says sexism can apply to men and racism can apply to white people. 
 
 2. Dysphoria is the will to be the opposite gender and transgender is the will to be the opposite gender. You might notice that it is the same thing. It is like calling the size of paper a ""non-ledger tabloid"" (don't get me started about paper sizes) 
 
 3. It makes dysphoria meaningless. Thousands of people are dysphoric and suffer from it. Even the broad dysphoria definition proposed ontop can cause psychological problems. Why make the word meaningless? 
 
 4. (mostly a counter to point 6) most transphobic people's argument is ""you gender is unrelated to how you feel"".

 Ive noticed a strong trend in a lot of comedic movies, especially when surrounding sex. Multiple movies will have a scene where the man is put into a scenario where he doesnt want sex or to be touched, but the woman will persist to the point where it is 100% rape, but the way the scene is set, it makes you believe its comedic. But switch the roles where a woman is not wanting the sexual advances and then the audience gasps and feel disturbed. And its completely the fault of the writers. Continuing a trend where its comedic when a man doesnt want it. 
 
 Thats not to say that there isnt comedic value in a ""get me the fuck outta here, this isnt what i signed up for"" type of scene. But the manner in which the scenes provoke sex, and then masked with comedy, starts a problem.

 Just make a stronger argument. ""It's coincidence"" is basically the null hypothesis and it doesn't make for great discussion because you can assume that about any claim, but it can still be accurate. You just need to have an argument for *why* you think it's coincidence. You put in the work to show exactly how the evidence provided is flimsy or the connection weak.

 It's been so driven into us by our basic biology and our modern society that 'sex is the means to happiness', that I feel we've moved back on ourselves. 
 
 We've turned sex into a commodity, with the 'haves' and 'have nots'. It breeds jealousy and hatred, hence the incel community. 
 
 The attitude about not having it is hypocritical too. People will go out and say: ""There's nothing wrong with being a virgin!"" and then turn around and go ""Wow this guy isn't getting laid lol."" 
 
 Shit like this is why people feel pressured to go out and fuck just because they feel like they have to in order to be 'living'.

ek07dmw,"Recently, some scandals involving Seungri (member of Big Bang) and his club The Burning Sun exposed a lot of stuff. 
 
 He was providing prostitutes for potential investors (this is a bit political theater because everyone knows Korea is rampant with prostitution even though its illegal and the government doesn't do anything about it) 
 
 But also the security at his club was apparently helping VIPs drug girls and bring them back to the VIP rooms for sex/rape. 
 
 In addition to this, private messages from a chat group got leaked that involved multiple high profile people in the music industry chatting and talking about actually going out and raping girls (directly using the korean word for rape) and one was sharing secret videos of his sexcapades (which is a WHOLE other issue in Korea since they ban real porn sites so people share illegally filmed spy camera porn and such) including prefacing some of them saying that he was only filming because she was passed out because he knew she would say no. One of the girls involved is in Twice. 
 
 So with this, everything associated with Seungri and the others is fairly barren. His label owns some restaurants that feature some YG branding and they are totally empty, and the ramen shops franchised under his Aori Ramen brand are also virtually empty all the time. 
 
 Shits wild. Like, when you see crazy western feminists call America a rape culture, on so many of those points, Korea LEGITIMATELY is a rape culture in so many ways.","AffiliationDirectedAbuse,PersonDirectedAbuse",1

 the problematic part is not the inclusion of a revived, politically significant, openly racist and fascist (sorry to anyone who don't know this, but the rise of so-called ""populism"" you see on the right is a rise of fascism, read a book) confederacy in WW2, but rather the prospect of individual players identifying with the confederacy and what such play indicates and consists in. is it okay to role play as lynching thugs? 
 it's a deep question, honestly. contextualized properly, one can do interesting things with it. other art forms employ genuine antiheroes (like tony soprano, who is, simply, a psychopath) and do good things (criticize capitalism, and the emotional/intellectual dissociation involved with immoral behavior both localized and structural/systemic). what does ""I'M the character"" do to change it? in a book, we're often in the person's mind. their thoughts replace ours in a focused narrative. is that alright? will i become a psychopath if i read such media? 
 i don't know. i think it merits discussion, but the statement the guy made sounds fine to me. are they cashing in on the rise of the alt-right and open white supremacy in america? i don't know. do we want to allow role playing games and alternate reality media? that one, i'm pretty comfortable with yes. we need to do deeper, broader, better things to eliminate white supremacists than make sure they can't role play as the confederacy joining WW2.

 They designed the bill to give a small tax cut to the lower and middle class so they can be push the talking points and fool the American public (or at least sell it to their base) into thinking that the bill benefits them. 
 
 But the scam is that the tax bill lowered the taxes for the wealthy elite and massive corporations in a much more skewed and beneficial way, effectively negating any benefit the lower and middle class would have seen had this bill been passed in good faith. 
 
 It's a con. That's what people are upset about. Too many ignorant people being taken advantage of by liars and propagandists with malicious intent. 
 
 Similar to the way the Republicans push the talking points about a potential universal health care system, ""But taxes will go up!"" they cry, while ignoring that people will pay less overall because of the redundancy of health insurance costs under such a system (obviously this debate would depend on the language of the legislation involved).",AffiliationDirectedAbuse,1

 I think the thing that confuses me the most about ""trap"" as to whether it is offensive or not, is that the only times I ever see it used in reference to real people or in real life is for NSFW purposes, and I think, at least in my experience, people have very different definitions on whether something is offensive when it's being used explicitly for those scenarios.

 And the source of life. Death itself is a source of life. Why is death evil? You seem pretty down on the concept of life, how do you come to the conclusion that death is evil unless you accede that life is good? As death would necessarily be the conclusion or absence or antithetical of life.

She mentions being extremely uncomfortable around the large, boisterous 20-somethings staying in her neighbor's apartment (completely understandable given her trauma), but can't see why her elderly neighbors similarly aren't comfortable with a large dog running around in the hallways of their apartment complex off-leash. 
 
 Even if OP is willing to stake her reputation on the temperament of her pet, the _threat_ of a large dog wandering around that might without notice jump at/play rough with you in ways that are acceptable with 19-year olds but not with geriatrics is a detriment to her neighbor's quality of life. My uncle had a beautiful black lab when I was younger, sweet as could be, but we couldn't let him off-leash around my grandma because his idea of affection (leaning against you/pawing your knee for treats) were enough to knock her off balance/bruise her skin. 
 
 Sorry for the rant but ESAs are a real hot-button issue for me, especially dogs. There are countless people out there who benefit immensely from having a fuzzy bundle of unconditional affection in their lives, and for some that's literally all they need to get themselves together and better their lives. However, just because your dog is classified as an ESA _does not relieve you of the basic duties of being a dog owner_. That dog is not a functional member of society; it cannot feed, house or otherwise provide for itself. By bringing that animal into your life you are making a promise to it that you will provide it with all of the food, shelter, exercise, socialization, and whatever else it needs to be the best emotional support animal it can be. For a lot of people with self-worth/anxiety issues this isn't a problem; caring for your dog is a great way to build constructive habits that can lead to the confidence to tackling your own problems. 
 
 If you are unable to provide this (which is _fine_ and quite possibly is no fault of your own), you need to seriously evaluate whether bringing an ESA into your home is going to help lift yourself up, or just drag your new friend down to your level. 
 
 **edit:** Wanted to clarify something because I went from ""unconditional love"" to ""social contract"" in the same paragraph: if you adopt a dog and do the _bare minimum_ to keep it alive, that thing's gonna love the shit out of you. Doesn't matter if it's overweight, sick, or whatever, that poor fuzzball doesn't know any better.

bvtk71-post,"Hello Reddit, I hope everyone is having a good night. I just got home after a 30 min wait for a 10 min train. I just feel like utter shit right now. You see, I was at a party with friends- a lot of them. I think around 20-30 of my closest friends were there. We were all having fun but it's been a really long day, and I got really fucking tired. I sat down for a bit but people kept glancing at me, and I felt terrible. I developed a headache around that time as well. I just feel bad because I know there's no good ending for me. If people noticed me feeling bad, I felt bad for being a killjoy. If people didn't notice, I would feel like I don't matter. 
 
 
 
 I've been struggling with some problems recently. Lots of stress from my job, lots of stuff coming up soon. I just don't feel secure anymore. How could I not have fun in a room with my closest friends? In the moment, I literally did not feel like I cared about anything. Their singing, their dancing, their everything just irritated me. I have not been diagnosed with any mental illness and I only feel a drive to just get back to work now. I just don't know what to do with my life anymore. Thank you to anyone who read the whole thing. I hope you guys have a good night.",Neutral,0

 This is my biggest issue on this sub, people with no formal education on a subject mistaking actual facts for ignorance because again, they have no formal education on the subject. 
 
 Fascism is completely fluid, that's why you identify fascism using a set of emotional traits and national mood. 
 
 > Even scholars who specialize in the quest for fascism's intellectual and cultural origins, such as George Mosse, declare that the establishment of a ""mood"" is more important than ""the search for some individual precursors."" In that sense too, fascism is more plausibly linked to a set of ""mobilizing passions"" that shape fascist action than to a consistent and fully articulated philosophy. At bottom is a passionate nationalism. Allied to it is a conspiratorial and Manichean view of history as a battle between the good and evil camps, between the pure and the corrupt, in which one's own community or nation has been the victim. In this Darwinian narrative, the chosen people have been weakened by political parties, social classes, unassimilable minorities, spoiled rentiers, and rationalist thinkers who lack the necessary sense of community.

 Blacks do go into the woods to enjoy the outdoors through activities like hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, etc... But, blacks only make up about 13% of the population of America. Also, not many blacks actually go into the woods; only a very small percentage of them are active in the wild outdoors. Therefore, I suspect that of all of the humans that regularly go into the woods in North America, probably less than 1% of them are black. 
 
 Why bring this up? My point here is that Bigfoot is not used to seeing black folks. This may provoke certain responses by a Sasquatch when it sees a black person, such as: 
 
 1. Confusion; 
 2. Fear; 
 3. Trepidation; and 
 4. Curiosity 
 
 I believe that all of these are responses that can work to our advantage. All of these potential responses will cause a Bigfoot some amount of pause, and this slight pause may be the difference between getting off a kill shot and not. 
 
 The fact is, sasquatch does not regularly see black people. Chances are better than not that when a Squatch sees a black person that it will be the first time it has ever seen one. It may get scared and freak out, or it may stand there and stare. 
 
 As a practical matter I think that a technique worth trying is to take a black person on some hunts. See how the Squatch population reacts to the black person and take note. I am aware of no other groups that have tried this, so I will be very interested to see the results. 
 
 There are all sorts of variations on this concept. The goal here is to throw a Bigfoot off balance with some sort of odd occurrence in the woods. The idea is to create a weird scene in an area where Bigfoot are present and which is not threatening to the creature. At the same time, you want it to perplex the BF to the point where it is standing there just scratching its head at the spectacle. While this is going on we will have snipers strategically placed whose job is to locate the Sasquatch and to put a bullet in the animal's head. 
 
 Here are some other ideas I have to cause a Bigfoot to pause due to confusion: 
 
 1. Outdoors sex/orgy: Get some skanky swingers group together and get them into the woods to screw and orgy in a Bigfoot hotspot. This will really pique a scratch's interest. At some point a Squatch will stick out its head to see what the fuck all that sucking and slapping noise is, then one of our snipers blows his brain out! 
 
 2. Poker game in the woods: same concept as the orgy but less gross. It probably will take longer to attract a Squatch. 
 
 3. Strange looking people: these are people that Squatch are not used to seeing. For example, dress up like a party clown and walk around in a hotspot zone juggling bowling pins. 
 
 4. Fighting: put together a group of low-life fight-club types, take them into the woods and let them fight. The noise and weird scene will generate some Bigfoot interest. 
 
 Some believe that Sasquatch are something like forest ninjas: fast and stealthy. I think that if you do something truly weird then we may be able to confuse and agitate the animal. Confusion and agitation does not comport with stealth and concealment. Therefore, we take the Squatch's advantage away from it. This will make it t more likely to show itself and, thereby, give us a shot at it.",Neutral,0

ercuh1r,"Hey, I'm the developer of Supraland. I was just shown this and was asked to share my POV. 
 
 So the baseline of what I understood is that she associates with EVERY woman displayed anywhere. So if a woman is stupid, shy or subserviant, she feels insulted. 
 
 And my point was: everyone is an individual, you are not all of those women. 
 
 And then she said that I should also feel bad if there is a stupid man in a movie, but I have no point to feel that way. I am not that guy. 
 
 Originally all stick figures in the game were male and it was also perceived as that by many, so I decided to put in female stick figures as well. So her perception that they look genderless was not shared by most. 
 
 In Supraland there are a few dumb teeny fangirls admiring a suprastar. That was the worst moment for her. She says that all women in the game are weak. She ignored that the main woman, the queen, is more dominant than both of the kings and is showing them the way, and she is also ordering the player around. 
 
 So it seems that she wants all women to be strong and dominant. But the thing is, what hormons people run on is different from case to case. Depending on what happened to you in your life you run on different hormons. For example when a woman loses her man, she usually becomes more masculine to be able to survive and she becomes more feminine again when she gets a man again. 
 
 Some women run on masculine hormones and are the tough ones. Many women are very feminine and enjoy being subserviant - and because of that nature they have no voice in public, because only dominant more masculine women are so extrovert to raise their voice. That is probably the reason for the disconnect between the media and the people. 
 
 Same thing for men - many men are more on the feminine side and soft and also have a hard time in this society with it. 
 
 
 And my point of view in general: let everyone be just the way they are and let them do whatever they want. Don't force feminine people into being masculine, don't force masculine people into being feminine. Everyone is an individual.",IdentityDirectedAbuse,1

 They didn't really hate on the Sequels so much; they found things to criticize because it's their job, but what they don't like is how Disney is essentially milking the property for all it's worth. They actually mentioned in one video that -- as much as they don't like how Lucas made the movies -- at least Lucas was judicious about making them. 
 
 Likewise for Star Trek. They don't like how Star Trek has had to contort itself into the ""Action"" part of the sci-fi genre to try to remain commercially relevant when the earlier television shows could go multiple episodes in a row without a single action scene. 
 
 That said, I can't say they're not hypocritical, either. They definitely can be, but also, they let you know constantly that this is all their opinion and you shouldn't take it for more than a subjective take on the current state of the IPs. 
 
 If anything, watching their Best of the Worst series has made me much more comfortable enjoying the movies I do, because it highlights the importance of entertainment over everything else.

ar1ras-post,"That and, if reddit's community didn't use the downvote button as a disagree button, I wouldn't be writing this post. 
 
 I do not like the current fad of releasing remakes and remasters of everything, especially in Nintendo consoles. Additionally, I am not a fan of Nintendo's practices of charging double the price for ports than you see on other consoles (Skyrim costs twice as much on the Switch than on the PS4/XBOX, the new Final Fantasy ports are apparently all at least 40€). 
 
 I am certainly not the only person who thinks this, because it is not the first time I see threads and comments being showered with replies that can be summed up to 'shut up and accept it' and flurries of downvotes. 
 
 Some of us do not need to relive our childhood, teenagehood or whatever with constant remakes or remasters. Some of us would like new original content or sequels. But since most people keep buying these, companies have realized they can have more profit with half the work by remaking, remastering and re-releasing these games with special edition instead of focusing on other, different projects. This is what gives us stuff like Pokémon Let's Go, which were considered very lackluster remakes with less effort put in them than the remakes that were released over ten years before and what also makes us buy games that are no more than beta versions, since DLC/complete versions come out the year later. 
 
 I am not trying to attack eventual posters that identify with this mindset I am disagreeing with. There are remakes/remasters that are really good to introduce a new generation to a certain game (Pokémon Fire Red/Leaf Green, The 3DS Zelda remasters), but there is a growing trend of remakes/remasters/complete edtions that are basically just to profit as much as they can off one game without altering it much.

 I'm glad to hear she did at least try and can see he went way way over the top. Maybe try talking with her 1 on 1 so maybe since she has experienced similar feelings in the past she would be more understanding of your perspective and how serious it is and that you do need support. 
 
 A few comments said that you need to cut ties the toxicity in your life but at the moment that is more or less impossible and would cause too much grief for you and they are a part of your support network and that's something that is important to have (a support network) and maintain. I think your dad is just confused and doesn't know how to handle just mental health on a whole maybe having a heart to hear with your mum could help her help him to learn more about this kinda stuff so he can help you because I'm sure all he wants is to help you but just doesn't know how to, and maybe he is struggling aswell and just doesn't know it properly sand doesn't currently have the mental capacity needed to take proper care of you. There are so many things that could have attributed to his his actions that have nothing to do with you and could be a case of poorly directed and understood emotions, Has he been under any stress or pressure at work?, Unexpected bills, a loss of a loved wrong?, problems at home or job security? , or maybe him seeing you at the age you are taking steps into college has him thinking of the past or whatever and that's gotten him down(like him not being where he'd like to be in life idk I'm not a councillor). Idk sorry you said like everything was lovely before so I'm trying to think about what could be the underling cause for why he reacted in such a horrible way, I'm sure he regrets what he said and feels bad for it. I hope he does. And I hope he will come around soon and acknowledge what he said and apologises to you. Sorry I hope you get what I'm trying to say. 
 
 But above all you need to look out for you and trying to protect your mental state is most important so if that means ASAP moving out work towards what you have to do to achieve that so you can at least get that space to become level headed which in turn will help you be able to feel better. And hopefully fix and build a healthy relationship with your dad if you do decide that it is something you want. 
 
 
 It will be hard, you will have feelings to end it all, you will want to give up and it will feel pointless. But I promise you that it won't be worth it. You will struggle your entire life. Everyone does in their own way that's just the sad 'shitty' fact of life. But as life goes on you build experience of dealing with the shit life throws at ya and get better at coping with your thoughts and feelings and someday in the future you will be faced with a problem and then think back and think to yourself ""wow if X was a problem 2 years ago that would have been enough to make me tie the rope there and then. But it's a problem now and I'm okay"". And that's something you will be happy to acknowledge that you have progressed in yourself and all the suffering we go through conditions us to who we are going to be in the future like for example if in the future you become a parent I have no doubt you will be a amazingly supportive and loving parent because you will understand what it's like to feel certain feelings. 
 
 Sorry I'm on phone so terrible formatting and what not I truly hope for the best for you OP please take care of yourself and I hope you can see what I'm trying to say please let me know if there is something I said that doesn't make sense or worded wrong. If you find yourself needing someone to talk to feel free to msg me I'm happy to talk.

The emotional turmoil is strong, I'm well aware, but not being a virgin anymore doesn't make you a slut or whatever. 
 
 To me the emotional side of the story far, far outweighs the physiological slight change. A hymen maketh not the good woman.

 I can kind of understand people getting increasingly hostile to the FB style posts. Those types of posts hit critical mass a long time ago. This post was just terrible. If it ties into a post on another subreddit, then it should have been posted there. 
 
 People used to point out the sub is for interesting pictures as a complaint and the mods removed ""interesting"" from the sidebar. When progress pics were overwhelming the sub people started posting selfies with their gym pass when they bought one. Then there was a post that hit the top that was just a selfie of an overweight dude that said he was planning to buy a gym membership. 
 
 Devoid of any context this photos aren't interesting in the least. Voters seem to prefer these uninteresting backstory posts while people who actively comment do not. Since the mods have made it clear they care more about the voting group than the commenting group, frustration is going to build. Being over the line insulting to people posting isn't called for, but I see why it happens.",Neutral,0

 I've been recovered from bulimia for like a year and partially recovered for 2. I've been eating whatever I want because if I try and restrict what I eat, it just sends me down a really unhealthy guilty path that I'm not in the place to go down anymore. 
 
 The problem is I've gotten fat. My BMI is technically healthy (23) but we all know it doesn't mean anything. I'm in the middle of some serious exams and I can't excersize right now because I need to study all the time. All I can feel is my legs touching and my stomach rolling on itself and my flabby arms and the extra skin on my back and the flab on my waist and my fat neck. I don't know how much of this is dysmorphia and how much is me being fat, but I'm fine most of the time until it hits me in waves like it is now. 
 
 I tried to take some nudes and my body just seemed wrong. I tried to put on a pair of shorts but they've gotten so tight they barely fit. I bought all my clothes when I was BMI 16.5-19 and they're so tight and ill-fitting now, and I can't afford more. 
 
 I really just wish I could take a scissors and chop off all the fat. It's so unfair, because whenever I see someone who has told me they recovered from an eating disorder, they look normal. They haven't gained loads of weight like me. I just want to go on a diet, but I promised myself I'd eat whatever I want until the end of this year, to let myself get used to this new body. If I start dieting I'm scared I'll just hate myself more. I'm so annoyed I just wish I didn't feel like this.",Neutral,0

aujl5i-post,"Background: 21 years old, chubby, friendless, haven't kissed a girl or even held her hand yet. I feel like I've missed out on a lot of things I should've had experienced by now & that it's probably too late to catch up. 
 
 Every day is as boring as the previous one. If someone was looking at me all day, all they would see would be some fat guy sitting in front of a gigantic screen with a poker face. 
 
 It's sad, man. Every year I feel like it's too late to change, only to regret not having tried one year later. I wish I could go back in time and tell 17 years old me that no, it's not too late to get in shape, as you'll still wish to be ripped when you're 21. Or go back and tell 18 years old me that it is too early to give up any hopes of ever kissing a girl or having a social life. The list goes on. But sadly, I can't change my past. 
 
 What's even more depressing is that it is pretty much entirely my fault. Yes, I do have overprotective parents, but I should have done something. If only I had told them to fuck off whenever they asked where I was going, with who, and that endless amount of questions they asked (and still ask) me every time I opened the door, my life could have been a lot more different. 
 
 Nowadays, I often act against my own interests solely out of fear. For example: some weeks ago, I messaged a girl I had been texting for around a month (I don't know if I like her as a friend & it's just my mind playing tricks on me because of my inexperience or if I actually like her romantically) at around 3 am and since I didn't get an answer half an hour later I decided to pop some sleeping pills and head to bed. 
 
 Right after waking up, I saw her reply. She answered 10 minutes after I knocked myself out. Said she was at some club and told me to drop by if I wanted. A few minutes later, she mentioned that she was going to the beach later if I wanted to go. And that she was leaving the town we both were at at a certain hour. 
 
 What did I do? I saw the message an hour before she said she would leave (in the notification panel with my phone in flight mode so she wouldn't know I saw it) and answered an hour after she left with some crappy excuse as to why I couldn't answer earlier. Even though I really wanted to see her. 
 
 My lack of social skills angers me. I know I would've done the exact same thing if I hadn't gone to bed before her reply. Why? Because I fear that my awkwardness would drive her away. Especially at a nightclub (only went three times to one, none of them were 'successful' nights at all). The beach was also a terrifying idea because in addition to having zero social skills, I'm not happy with my body at all. 
 
 It's not that I'm an introvert. Socializing tends to make me happier and more energetic for the rest of the day. It kills me when I find something funny on the internet and I have no one to share it with. Or when I want to go to the movies or something and I have no one to go with. I dislike being by myself most of the time. I'd love to have a group of friends to go out and have fun with. Or even go on vacations with, like some do. But since I tend to bore people on one-on-one conversations and I usually get kind of ignored when in a group, it looks like an unattainable goal. And I'd love to go to nightclubs, but I don't have the social skills to really enjoy it. 
 
 I've recently tried to lose weight again, successfully. Lost 6% bodyfat but I 'gave up' again two weeks ago. I'm struggling once again with the false belief that it's too late to improve. That the door has already closed. The same dumb questions arise: ""Why would I want to be ripped at 22? Will I even be able to catch up with social skills? Will it even be worth it?"".

 Real mental health awareness could save a lot of lives in this country. Imagine if everyone got the help they needed? People could have meaningful relationships. People could enjoy things again. People would stop killing themselves and each other in droves.

 It's a touchy subject but if you don't make the distinction you can't put the blame where it really belongs. Psychos are psycho.

 Sometimes I wonder what's wrong with me, because I cry so easily as well, and things get to me quickly, why I struggle standing up for myself etc. And you just put into words what I always kind of knew myself but couldn't verbalise.

 Of course, (unfortunately) that doesn't mean it isn't necessary to toughen up, because that's the world we live in, and while I wish people sometimes had more understanding and empathy for others, i can't expect to have the whole world change because of how i am.

In Africa, 100 elephants are killed every day for their ivory. That number is increasing yearly. 2015 was the first year when the number of elephants being killed was more than those being born. If this disparity continues, African elephants could face extinction within our lifetime. In Asia, though poaching for ivory is a serious problem as well, elephants are also being killed for their skin. Whereas in Africa only elephants with ivory are killed, every Asian elephant is a target for their skin which means that they could face extinction sooner than African elephants. Additionally, in Asia, many elephants are facing an unnatural and cruel life by also being kept in captivity for a variety of purposes: logging, tourism, cultural and religious activities, and transportation.",Neutral,0

 Firstly - while it's the first 'picture of a black hole', it's not. I've seen numerous images in the past which explored gravitational lensing, and the plasma jets associated with black holes. I'm not minimising the achievement here, but as always the mainstream press are singularly clueless and screw up any story about science. 
 
 Secondly - there were indeed a number of stories and narratives that singled out Katie Bouman and pushed her part in the story out of context and out of proportion. Let us note that all of the media who did this are also media who have been labelled regressive and biased. 
 
 From the Washington Post: *Meet Katie Bouman, the young woman behind the first image of a black hole* 
 
 From CNet: *Meet Katie Bouman, the woman who transformed our view of black holes forever* 
 
 The BBC: *Katie Bouman: The woman behind the first black hole image* 
 
 CNN: *That's where Bouman's algorithm — along with several others — came in* 
 
 Having pushed their distorted narrative they then left Katie to be the one to suffer the kickback for it. 
 
 Now let us note the following. I think this image is a major step forward and was very excited about it. Not as excited as I was when CERN had their announcement about the Higgs Boson, but excited just the same. 
 
 Furthermore I think everyone involved, including Katie Bouman and the subteam she lead, should be extremely proud and deservedly so. 
 
 And I think that any harassment that Katie Bouman may be receiving is bullshit. And it's very clear that the mainstream media are to blame for creating the situation.",Neutral,0

 I was kind of in a similar situation to yours. Got rejected from a 3D art school, and they pretty much took anyone so I felt like shit. At that point I had also been looking for employment for more than a year and i just kept getting rejected/no answer. 
 
 I eventually decided to not pursue college as it seemed unnecessary to my career plans, and rather fully focus on personal projects and also work on other people's animated short films (Artella.com). This was a huge help, (but definitely took a while), it got me stuff to put on my reel that looked like feature animation basically. At this point I was constantly sending my work to people in the industry, and getting feedback, redoing, getting more feedback, etc etc. 
 
 Getting the job felt like luck, which sucks to say, I really did just apply at the right time, when they really needed people (tends to be late spring/summer for most VFX houses). Someones going to have to take a risk on you, and they wont do that until you know, your confident that your reel is up to standards with modern day animation/VFX. 
 
 You tend to see a lot of negative connotations around the industry, and people telling you to get out while you can. I was fully aware of that when I was feeling unmotivated after lots of rejections. But I wouldn't let it get to ya, try the industry for yourself before taking someone else's word for it. Sure there are people that grow out it, but I've seen people that genuinely still love what they're doing even after many many years.

et5a1gr,"Yeah that's essentially what I was trying to say. It's alright if you say the murderer acted like a yandere character would, I'd also say it's cool, albeit a bit cringy, if you're watching a movie or series where a character kills someone over jealously and you call that a yandere. 
 
 But in the context of real life with real people, unless you're making a dark joke, you shouldn't really be calling a murderer via an anime stereotype because it's innacurate. Yandere is a thing in anime because of the context the media is built. 
 
 In the same manner, traps don't mind being called traps because they don't exist, it doesn't help increase hate crime rate of anime characters if you address them by that term, and 'trap' has a use for anime community because it identifies characters that do not fall correctly under the trans nor crossdresser label. The problem is that anime culture reached out way outside it's bubble and people that have no idea what the term reffers to started using it wrongly. 
 
 A trans person would be someone born in the wrong body, they feel the other gender and have the need to be more like the other gender. 
 
 A crossdresser is a person that is of a gender but likes dressing up as the other gender from time to time. 
 
 What the term trap tries to define are anime characters that dress up and act like another gender, and sometimes even go as far as saying they feel like the gender they're going by, but doesn't actually suffer from gender dysphoria. What makes this term not really useable for real people is the fact that you can never assume a person isn't suffering from gender dysphoria because *they* are the only ones able to tell what they're suffering from, as with a fictional character it's entirely alright to assume they aren't suffering from something if the narrative doesn't imply they are.

 I then pointed out that nobody was arrested at the protest, so my original claim was 100% true, and that arrests didn't occur until 6 weeks later after a backlash from MPs, the media, and the public. 
 
 He then deleted my original post and all of the posts I made proving that I was right, leaving only his claim that I was a liar, along with posts from other people saying I was too cowardly to respond, even though I HAD responded, only for him to delete my responses.

 The age issue tells a lot and it's the reason why conservatives better understand liberal policy and beliefs than vice verse (Righteous Mind - Johnathan Heidt). Most conservatives were already liberals in their younger days so they understand their views, sometimes they even feel sympathy for them. Conservatives commonly say in regards to the left ""oh, they'll grow out of it"". But liberals rarely know what it's like to be conservative so their views are that they just pure evil or stupid.

emu3bzq,"Establishing and maintaing a business is a difficult and arduous task, that requires massive dedication and a large investment of time, money and effort. Start-up business owners can't just lay back and do meaningless paperwork while the profits roll in; they have to work their arses off to get their businesses off the ground. 
 
 If a business becomes successful, and they can begin to afford to hire someone else to do some of the work, then they have earned the right to own their ""means of production"". But even the owners of large businesses often still have to work hard to ensure that their business does not collapse. The fact that they are no longer physically labouring is irrelevant; it is a job that requires skill, experience and dedication- and one that most people are unable to fill. 
 
 The customer of the business pays money to the business owner to receive the desired product, and the worker receives a certain amount of money to operate the means of production that the business owner has worked to obtain. Any profit that the business owner gains is his payment for the work that he has put in.",Neutral,0

 The Reign of Terror, or The Terror (French: la Terreur), is the label given by most historians to a period during the French Revolution after the First French Republic was established. 
 
 Several historians consider the ""reign of terror"" to have begun in 1793, placing the starting date at either 5 September, June or March (birth of the Revolutionary Tribunal), while some consider it to have begun in September 1792 (September Massacres), or even July 1789 (when the first lynchings took place), but there is a consensus that it ended with the fall of Maximilien Robespierre in July 1794.Between June 1793 and the end of July 1794, there were 16,594 official death sentences in France, of which 2,639 were in Paris.

 It is hard to find a man that really seems to want a serious relationship which guarantees marriage, you must know yourself how MUCH HARDER it is when half the boys don't even give you a chance. 
 
 
 You said that life is fleeting, enjoy every opportunity instead of chasing a prince on a horse, because whatever you might believe of yourself, you can make no good judgement on which unlikely relationship will turn into *that one*. Nobody likes incertainty, nobody likes to talk of serious shit when they don't even know the person well, even less so if they don't know the person well and the person is also someone in your case. Give every improbable relationship a chance of knowing you AND put NO pressure on it. No obe wants to hear the stranger they've been dated for 3 weeks is dead-serious about long-term commitment and has more string attached than a corset. 
 
 
 
 And in case you might start with 'You don't understand'... well, you might not actually understand it either. It is easy to be isolated, refused, frail, and to think you have had all the time in the world to know how things work. It is easy to let the hatred or spite that grows from the feeling of injustice get the better of you. It is also easy to let yourself down. The world is not as naked when you don't have the full picture, even less when you think you had it because of overthinking and over-analysing stuff. 
 
 
 Good things will come for you once you let yourself open. But to let yourself open you need not to let yourself down, not to think you understand the world, relationships and partners as well as you might do, and especially, you need to take the risk of losing time and offering yourself a chance with people that might not appear as commited as you wish, even if it is not what you think you want.",Neutral,0

ekecwyi,"I think you need to think about your audience when you're making those comments, instead of taking it personally. 
 
 In a subreddit about anxiety, maybe they are too anxious to respond. Maybe they are busy fighting with anxiety and don't want to type out a long response to you. Maybe they read your post, appreciated it, and then the thought of getting help overwhelmed them. Maybe they never saw it at all because they panicked and logged out after posting. 
 
 In a subreddit about depression, maybe they are too depressed to respond. Maybe they are busy fighting depression. Maybe they appreciated your post, but can't gather the energy/motivation to type a response to it. Maybe they feel they've already wasted enough of your time. 
 
 In a confession subreddit (or one like this one), people aren't necessarily posting for your input. Maybe they just need to write it down and get it out there. Sometimes a person doesn't want advice in that case, so replying saying ""thanks for the advice!"" feels fake. Maybe they completely disagree with everything you've said and don't want to be petty and be like ""Thanks but nothing you said is right and you're not helping at all"". Or, maybe they read and appreciate the advice, but they don't think thanking everyone who gives unsolicited advice is a good idea. 
 
 All of those are subreddit-specific reasons, but there's also reasons like... maybe they got a lot of responses and don't want to reply 20 times saying ""Thanks!"". Maybe your comment is identical to 5 other people and they've already explained/answered your questions elsewhere and don't want to do it again. Maybe they intend to reply, but get interrupted and forget. Maybe they don't see replying to random reddit people as a priority. 
 
 In short, it's probably not personal. Just relax. No one is an asshole just because they don't thank you for your advice. Your advice should be like a gift - they don't owe you anything in return, and if they do, it's not really a gift.",Neutral,0

 It comes from selective understanding. Both of those points aren't necessarily contradictory depending on just how you're viewing them and how you're making those points. 
 
 The idea of Piracy not being a lost sale comes from the idea that a number of people who pirate games would not buy it in the first place, and would only play it if they can pirate it. Think teenagers without their own spending money, or people trying out a game because they *can* without paying, but wouldn't bother trying it if they had to pay for it. The idea of it potentially helping comes from these same people enjoying the game and recommending it to other people, who in turn actually pay for the game. Along with some of the people who pirate it enjoying it to the point where they want to support the devs. 
 
 Where this comes to potentially hurting the developers, well, the important phrase in the last paragraph is ""a number of people"". As we can see from these threads, the people who wouldn't buy it anyway aren't all of the people who pirate. They may not even be a large portion at all. For example, the people in this thread saying or implying they'll pirate it would otherwise buy the game if it was on Steam. They're doing it to stick it to the man in their eyes, because they *are* lost sales. And they're using the fact they don't want to support the Epic Games Store as a moral excuse. 
 
 Essentially, they are valid points, assuming the ""lost sale"" defense is based in reality which I can't comment on. But a lot of these people just want any moral excuse to pirate games and will use whatever feels the most convenient. Instead of just pirating and accepting it's wrong to do, but they don't care.",Neutral,0

es4yydj,"/r/fullcommunism got quarantined a long time ago. Somehow an endless fit was not thrown over it though in billionaire funded right wing propaganda journals. The left is censored all the time, in fact I'd say it's far more extreme than anything extended to the right. The right just views itself as the sole legitimate political view in America and is furious than open white supremacy isn't tolerated anymore at the same time that anything to the right of Hitler is allowed to exist. 
 
 Of course the first response of liberal idiots after this is to seek to find a leftist scalp to make everything 'fair'. Literally a moment cannot pass without us being stabbed in the back by liberals so that they can do some moralistic both sides garbage. And afterwards the right just literally spits at them in the face, like it never once in history has satisfied the right. The appeasement doesn't make them any happier or more grateful to the idiot liberals, it just becomes another tool in their box they can use in their attempt to destroy humanity. And then of course they stick their nose down to their ass and sniff deeply and boast about how 'fair they were' when though they're 'a progressive too'. 
 
 Do the idiot liberals care? No. Because they are fucking cucks incapable of anything. If there were five rightists and a billion liberals, the nation would inevitably become the successor to nazi Germany. Liberalism is the ideology of weakness, it knows no strategy but appeasement. 
 
 Unlike the rightists though, we will not run to our billionaires and massive propaganda machine and whine and cry endlessly. We will continue on unphased, we will organize. Until victory, always. We do not consider ourselves entitled to the world, we know we have to fight for it. We are used to setbacks and betrayal, a liberal cannot breathe without betraying.","AffiliationDirectedAbuse,IdentityDirectedAbuse",1

euctu9u,"I really wanted to not comment on this, but its incredibly frustrating when people post this comment because its so tone deaf. 
 
 First, the Pride event started as a riot. It wasn't a happy parade with rainbows and dance music. It was a bunch or angry gays finally saying ""we've had enough"" and standing up to police brutality and raids on gay spaces. 
 
 Since then, the movement has endured the AIDS Crisis, and we only had each other when the government did nothing. 
 
 We created new spaces to welcome in the people who never fit into society. 
 
 And for the decades, LGBTQ+ youth have been the targets of hate crimes. They face hate speech and the fear of death in some places. Gay-youth have some of the highest rates of suicide in North America. 
 
 We have had to rally and throw our sexuality ""in your face"" just to fucking marry the person we love. 
 
 Gay people have been denied jobs, or fired because of their sexuality. 
 
 For many people, pride isn't ""just"" about celebrating being gay, its about celebrating that DESPITE being gay, we have survived the harassment, the violence, the depression and anxiety. Its about remembering those who did the hardest of the work to get us to where we are today. So yes, we absolutely should be proud of being gay and all the baggage that has come with it. Straight people aren't attacked for being straight. You have never been denied a job for being straight. You have had the privilege of being in the majority. To marry who you love. 
 
 Now, that being said there is a lot about pride that even I have issues with. But Pride reminds us of where we were and how far we've come. 
 
 And please, for the love of God, don't come at me with ""But no one cares about you being gay in 2019"" because that's bullshit. The Orlando shooting happened 3 years ago. A gay man in my town was stabbed - for being gay - just last summer. There are still countries where homosexuality is illegal.

ejts9ep,"Many stupid people are using the misquoted and invalid 40% statistic, so here goes. TL:DR; The 40% number is wrong and plain old bad science. In attempt to recreate the numbers, by the same researchers, they received a rate of 24% while including violence as shouting. Further researchers found rates of 7%, 7.8%, 10%, and 13% with stricter definitions and better research methodology. 
 
 The 40% claim is intentionally misleading and unequivocally inaccurate. Numerous studies over the years report domestic violence rates in police families as low as 7%, with the highest at 40% defining violence to include shouting or a loss of temper. The referenced study where the 40% claim originates is Neidig, P.H.., Russell, H.E. & Seng, A.F. (1992). Interspousal aggression in law enforcement families: A preliminary investigation. It states: 
 
 Survey results revealed that approximately 40% of the participating officers reported marital conflicts involving physical aggression in the previous year. 
 
 There are a number of flaws with the aforementioned study: 
 
 The study includes as 'violent incidents' a one time push, shove, shout, loss of temper, or an incidents where a spouse acted out in anger. These do not meet the legal standard for domestic violence. This same study reports that the victims reported a 10% rate of physical domestic violence from their partner. The statement doesn't indicate who the aggressor is; the officer or the spouse. The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The ""domestic violence"" acts are not confirmed as actually being violent. The study occurred nearly 30 years ago. This study shows minority and female officers were more likely to commit the DV, and white males were least likely. Additional reference from a Congressional hearing on the study: 
 
 An additional study conducted by the same researcher, which reported rates of 24%, suffer from additional flaws: 
 
 The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The study was not a random sample, and was isolated to high ranking officers at a police conference. This study also occurred nearly 30 years ago. 
 
 More current research, including a larger empirical study with thousands of responses from 2009 notes, 'Over 87 percent of officers reported never having engaged in physical domestic violence in their lifetime.' Blumenstein, Lindsey, Domestic violence within law enforcement families: The link between traditional police subculture and domestic violence among police (2009). Graduate Theses and Dissertations. 
 
 Yet another study ""indicated that 10 percent of respondents (148 candidates) admitted to having ever slapped, punched, or otherwise injured a spouse or romantic partner, with 7.2 percent (110 candidates) stating that this had happened once, and 2.1 percent (33 candidates) indicating that this had happened two or three times. Repeated abuse (four or more occurrences) was reported by only five respondents (0.3 percent)."" A.H. Ryan JR, Department of Defense, Polygraph Institute ""The Prevalence of Domestic Violence in Police Families."" 
 
 Another: In a 1999 study, 7% of Baltimore City police officers admitted to 'getting physical' (pushing, shoving, grabbing and/or hitting) with a partner. A 2000 study of seven law enforcement agencies in the Southeast and Midwest United States found 10% of officers reporting that they had slapped, punched, or otherwise injured their partners. L.

b8yvco-post,"I'm not sure if this is actually a thing or not but I'm going to break down each of memorable highs. 
 
 First time getting high: Grade 10, at lunch time. I couldnt walk, couldnt stand, barely could speak and sat in the woods for little over 4hours. I was generally afraid for my life and was listening to christian music thinking I was going to die. Finally some chick came over and helped me get home which I fellasleep and felt super exhausted when I woke up. 
 
 Second big high: Smoked with a lot of friends and played Fortnite, generally felt pretty good. I could only focus on one thing however, but when I focused on it I felt like I could really understand it. We were listening to music and I felt my ears could feel the beat in them (Like the Trap Nation logo in their videos but in my ears). If I rubbed my arms I could feel that same feeling over and over again even though I stopped doing it. Felt like my heart was pumping very fast and I was biting down hard on my teeth. I came to the conclusion that what I'm feeling is from the high, almost like a lucid high (??) Like I was awareness what I was feeling was from a high and I could control my high because I control my brain. If I opened my mouth I could still feel the feeling of my clenching my jaw, if I stopped putting my hand over my heart I could still feel my heart pounding. I could stop and continue effects, almost like I was coding my brain to stop and start whatever I wanted to do. 
 
 Last big high and last time smoking (2 weeks ago): 16% thc prerolls I bought at the liquor store, couldnt even finish the whole joint, got half way before I threw it out. I had to find an activity I could do because if I kept to myself I felt like I would get lost in my mind and eventually die. It felt like I was connecting all the dots to life, I had to snap myself out of thinking too much because it made me want to fallasleep and at the time falling asleep = death. I had to keep my mind away of thinking about my high, if I thought about it my heart felt like it would speed up, like a wheel and it would get faster and faster and then eventually it felt like someone was whipping my consicous, I'd think about something and then I'd hear the crack of a whip and the thought would be gone. I felt like my sober self was fighting my high self to see who could keep conscious and it was exhausting. I had to keep throwing out thoughts because I'd spiral farther down and couldnt stop myself. I tried watching Brooklyn 99 but I kep imagining my life as a movie, and what would someones reaction would be to what I was doing right now, then I'd imagine my reaction to me thinking about my life as a movie and the cycle would continue. I tried taking a shower but it felt too good and relaxing, It felt like my legs were telling my brain that they were done standing and going to give out soon. Overall it was like each part of my body was its own body and they all were trying to communicate at the same time. Then I decided to play Fortnite and LoL, first couple of games were rough but then I decided that if I control my brain I'll force myself to get into the perfect state of mind to play, so I did. Just thinking about the right state of mind allowed me to get in it, and I played the best I've ever played in my life. 
 
 What are my theories? I must be triggering some receptor or something in my brain that causes a episode. But I also think that while I'm high I control more of my brain because the thc receptors in my brain is filled up rather than being empty normally (if thats how it works). I generally believe that I can overdose on marijuana, and I want to get my brain checked out while I'm high, I'm fine with being the first person to OD on marijuana if it furthers the research.

ejtsbox,"Many stupid people are using the misquoted and invalid 40% statistic, so here goes. TL:DR; The 40% number is wrong and plain old bad science. In attempt to recreate the numbers, by the same researchers, they received a rate of 24% while including violence as shouting. Further researchers found rates of 7%, 7.8%, 10%, and 13% with stricter definitions and better research methodology. 
 
 The 40% claim is intentionally misleading and unequivocally inaccurate. Numerous studies over the years report domestic violence rates in police families as low as 7%, with the highest at 40% defining violence to include shouting or a loss of temper. The referenced study where the 40% claim originates is Neidig, P.H.., Russell, H.E. & Seng, A.F. (1992). Interspousal aggression in law enforcement families: A preliminary investigation. It states: 
 
 Survey results revealed that approximately 40% of the participating officers reported marital conflicts involving physical aggression in the previous year. 
 
 There are a number of flaws with the aforementioned study: 
 
 The study includes as 'violent incidents' a one time push, shove, shout, loss of temper, or an incidents where a spouse acted out in anger. These do not meet the legal standard for domestic violence. This same study reports that the victims reported a 10% rate of physical domestic violence from their partner. The statement doesn't indicate who the aggressor is; the officer or the spouse. The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The ""domestic violence"" acts are not confirmed as actually being violent. The study occurred nearly 30 years ago. This study shows minority and female officers were more likely to commit the DV, and white males were least likely. Additional reference from a Congressional hearing on the study: 
 
 An additional study conducted by the same researcher, which reported rates of 24%, suffer from additional flaws: 
 
 The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The study was not a random sample, and was isolated to high ranking officers at a police conference. This study also occurred nearly 30 years ago. 
 
 More current research, including a larger empirical study with thousands of responses from 2009 notes, 'Over 87 percent of officers reported never having engaged in physical domestic violence in their lifetime.' Blumenstein, Lindsey, Domestic violence within law enforcement families: The link between traditional police subculture and domestic violence among police (2009). Graduate Theses and Dissertations. 
 
 Yet another study ""indicated that 10 percent of respondents (148 candidates) admitted to having ever slapped, punched, or otherwise injured a spouse or romantic partner, with 7.2 percent (110 candidates) stating that this had happened once, and 2.1 percent (33 candidates) indicating that this had happened two or three times. Repeated abuse (four or more occurrences) was reported by only five respondents (0.3 percent)."" A.H.

 I don't see your point. Both implications of this view sound correct to me. Yes, it means incest is not wrong in and of itself, but only as a side-effect of being a power imbalance, and it means relatives who grew up sufficiently apart that they don't have a family power dynamic is morally fine.

c9nrl5-post,"A year ago I told my sister I was unsafe and took an Uber to a mental ward for the 7th (8?) time. I had been to this one once before and as soon as I walked in the ward I felt safe again. It was home. 
 
 One of the counselors there and I got very close. I'm ashamed to say he was everything I looked for in a person, not even in a sex/love way.As a kid I dreamed about a knight in shining armor, and he was exactly that. 
 
 He would talk to me personally every night, staying after his shift ended. I remember one night opening up to him about the abuse after all patients had gone to bed. He stayed so late that night, and I told him ""go home. You have a kid."" He told me ""I'm not leaving until I know you're safe. Those people are never allowed to visit. We'll report them together. I always knew there was more you weren't telling me, and now everything makes sense. It's okay. You're safe here, and I'm not letting anything else happen to you."" He said he didn't do all this for anyone. 
 
 Locked wards have very strict rules, and I broke them frequently. I slowly got all privileges taken away for multiple incidents. I would sleep in a chair next to the nurses station. I was only allowed to use crayons, since I abused pens. 
 
 But this counselor bent the rules and I was allowed to have my guitar. He knew how to play and would hold down the strings for me so I could have a capo. I played for relaxation most nights, and other patients would stay up just to listen. 
 
 Before I left, he told me ""the only way I'm ever allowed to hear about you, or see you on the news is if you get famous for music."" Meaning, he didn't want to hear that I had killed myself. 
 
 It's been so long, but sometimes I pray to him. I hope he gets the message and knows somehow I'm still breathing. I want him to know I've kept my promise. 
 
 I love him so much it hurts to hear his name, and I will never tell anyone because they think it's a crush. It's more than that. He saved me.

brdrgi-post,"She didn't work. She stayed home with our 2 kids. She got the house she wanted. She got the cars she wanted. I did all of the housework. I did all of the yard work. I learned to cut down tall trees and turn them into small logs for her. I learned to repair cars for her. I took her wherever she wanted go. Plays, vacations, concerts, art shows, festivals. Some days I would actually sit on the riding mower and think about how lucky I was. 
 
 Then my wife suffered an aneurysm. I spent 10 days shuttling between the hospital with my wife and the home with our kids. Whatever she wanted I brought to her. Whatever the kids needed, they got. The balls stayed in the air. 
 
 In the months following her release, I took care of her like a nanny. Whatever she wanted she got. She wanted a new car. We got her the top of the line package. She wanted a new TV. She wanted a new laptop. She wanted new clothes and a new kitchen. Done and done and done and done and done. 
 
 She entered peri-menopause. Everything that she could not control became Enemy. She became paranoid. She obsessed over the minutes between my end of work and when I got home. She obsessed over my daily mileage. An extra tenth of a mile or an extra minute meant that I was fucking the neighbor. She claimed that I tricked her into buying the new car and the new kitchen when she was weak. We did not have sex for the final three years of cohabitation. 
 
 The kids began to suffer. She became increasingly volatile and violent. Many times I came home to a broken interior door or a hole in a wall. If I was home I had to be ready to get between my wife and my children at the drop of a hat. He rmother pleaded with her to get professional help. Our pastor pleaded with her to seek professional help. I agreed to see a therapist with her and, after our third session, the therapist told her that she should seek help from a PhD level neuropsychologist. 
 
 Eventually the kids moved out of the house. She demanded that I remove them from my will. She demanded that I stop supporting them in any way. I was to stop their annual gifts. i was to stop paying for their health insurance. She threatened to call my HR department, pretending to be me, and remove them from my benefits. She stole tens of thousands of dollars from their accounts and was charged with multiple felonies. My children asked the prosecutor to go lightly on their mother and the charges were dropped after she returned their money. 
 
 Eventually she filed for a TRO because she claimed that I was stalking her. I moved out and filed for divorce. 
 
 I have offered to give her everything. The house that is nearly paid off and easily sold or refinanced. The cars that are paid off. Every single piece of movable property. All I want in return is my retirement. I just want to be shut of her. She refuses to respond to my offer. 
 
 She has filed for disablilty benefits so that she can receive spousal support. She has filed for multiple TROs, all denied. Denied but costly to the defendant. If one stuck I would probably lose my job. 
 She is hell-bent on bankrupting me even though it bankrupts her, too.

While I'm sure that there are trans women in ""trap"" porn, often times they are male identifying who aim for a feminine look. In that case the setting of the porn itself is that they are men trying to ""trick"" men, so it's an accurate description. Finally, when it comes to anime/manga the characters are also male identifying, outside of the (extremely rare) series where characters are transexual, and in those those issues are often addressed.",Neutral,0

 That's also how you can still be considered a hateful, harmful, *dangerous* person even if you treat transgendered people the same way you'd respectfully treat anyone else. I have a strong suspicion the fellow claiming TiA is a hate sub considers anyone who *doesn't* provide enthusiastic praise for being trans as ""hateful,"" hence why I mentioned the Anakin Skywalker mentality. 
 
 Which would necessarily include a lot of the transgendered/nonbinary TiA regulars who aren't fond of this shit either. Then again, activists like these are quite notorious for treating dissent among their own favored demographics as treason.",IdentityDirectedAbuse,1

 I think Total War's next big leap will only come when neural network AIs become commercially viable for games. There already are some remarkable projects - OpenAI in DotA and Google's DeepMind AI in Starcraft have shown great promise. They can defeat top teams without cheating, and while much of that seems to be due to mechanical advantages (perfect precision and coordination, even though the developers limited their actions per minute and reaction speed) they still behave awfully human in many situations and can be downright creative.",Neutral,0

etcyed9,"> According to the FBI, ""A hate crime is a traditional offense like murder, arson, or vandalism with an added element of bias."" The underlying problem with this definition is it elevates non-criminal activity to the level of a crime. Spray painting a phallus on the side of a building is vandalism. Spray painting a swastika on the side of a building is a hate crime. 
 > 
 > The first major problem we run into, then, is that the vast majority of recorded hate crimes fall into a number of activities that normally fall under misdemeanor or even civil categories. These actions include vandalism, simple assault and a vague category the FBI uses called ""Crimes Against Society."" Vandalism alone makes up a third of all events. It is troubling that the State elevates non-criminal matters into a criminal one based nothing on perpetrator motivation. The aforementioned swastika spray paint is no more difficult to clean off than a person scrawling their name. 
 > 
 > Digging further, the increase in reported hate crimes is driven primarily by these non-criminal acts. 
 > 
 > The disparity between real crime where people are harmed or property is irreparably lost and simple misdemeanor activity is staggering. 
 > 
 > An indicator hate crime isn't a problem is the rise of the hate crime hoax. According to researcher Wilfred Reilly, a Kentucky State professor of political science, there has been a [notable rise in hate crime hoaxes]( 
 > 
 > In today's United States, there is immense value in becoming a victim of a hate crime. There is an outpouring of social support, TV circuit interviews and other social benefits. Being seen as authentic is so strong that people become [distraught when they find out they're not the ethnicity they think they are]( these individuals are motivated to become a victim of such an event to solidify their social standing. 
 > 
 > Through the fact that there are *any* hoax events indicates that the problem of hate is, by and large, solved. 
 > 
 > [The overwhelming support such people obtain as the immediate snap decision ]( indicated that our society doesn't tolerate such behavior and, since society doesn't tolerate the behavior, finding individuals is equally rare. One doesn't need to raise awareness when the events are so few that cable news outlets can justify days of debate over each event; we're already pretty much aware the moment they happen. But one does need to raise awareness if they wish to have their 15 minutes of fame. 
 > 
 > [As I previously noted]( the number of people who buy into hate ideology, regardless of motivation, is so trivial that they couldn't even fill a minor league baseball stadium. There are more people than this who think the Earth is flat, yet no one considers that a growing trend. It would be impossible to casually talk about Nazis being evil if they had any semblance of power or authority as people would tread more carefully. Being anti-Nazi is a safe and easy way to win social points since there is almost zero risk of reprisal. Just ask Wilfred Reilly, who is on actual enemies lists, just how dangerous they are (they aren't). However, politicians, certain groups and many individuals have strong incentives to manufacture hate crimes where none exist as such events generate votes, revenue and social attention.

 Yes, that's correct. 
 
 Why do you think that is? You think you get upvotes because of respect? Because you're right? 
 
 The voting system is purely democratic. And it changes with the audience. If you put this comment on twitter directly under another person who was upset with Beiber, then you'd likely get heaps of likes. Unfortunately, they're useless and nobody should really care about them. 
 
 >...you have to find every single joke on the planet absolutely hilarious... 
 
 Who said that? Quote me one person in this thread or in the entirety of this comment section who said something along those lines. I seriously want to know. 
 
 I don't know anyone who says that. It's basically impossible to find most jokes funny. Not everyone can appreciate light humour like Piano Cat while still enjoying Holocaust jokes. But hey, if you can, then you're probably insane. 
 
 That being said, if you really hate certain jokes that much, ignore them. Anyone who tells speeches or does stand-up knows that the worst feeling you could have after saying something is not a unanimous reaction or a food execution, but just complete silence as everyone transitions to whatever else they were doing. 
 
 >I feel like the people who get bent out of shape when someone doesn't agree with them are the ones who are way too sensitive... 
 
 Yes. Again, yes. No one disagrees with you there, especially the aforementioned maniac. 
 
 I would go as far as saying most people who get bent out of shape are very sensitive, almost as if that's a defining trait of sensitive people, discounting those that are too shy to voice their opinion, of course.
